  with other nearby systems whilst in sleep mode. The game revolves around a
  player's chosen Mii, which can be customised with accessories earned from
  minigames, along with a short customizable message and some optional
  information about likes. When new Miis are registered by the system, they
  will appear at the gate. Up to ten Miis can show up at the gate at any one
  time, after which the player will need to use them with their minigames
  before checking for more. Meeting the same Miis multiple times adds extra
  functionality, such as personalised messages and the ability to rate them.
  There are also special Miis that appear via SpotPass during special events,
  such as Nintendo staff members. After meeting another player's Mii, the
  player can then use that Mii to play a variety of different games, three of
  them being playable free of charge: Puzzle Swap, StreetPass Quest, and
  StreetPass Quest II.
