developer: Konami

genre: Action;Platform
description:
  A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end. Once
  again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they
  huddle against new nightmarish horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count
  Dracula. And this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.
  .
  You must descend into Castle of the Undead and its gruesome ground, accompanied
  by the most chilling sound effects to ever tingle your spine. Inside, a freshly
  dug 11 levels maze features the treacherous Terrace of Terror, the dangerous
  Rotating Dungeon, the Sunken Ruins of Lost Spirits, torture chambers and
  creature filled caves. Use your whip like a grappling hook and swing past
  hundreds of traps and a host of ghost freaks, living corpses and hidden goblins.
  All while dodging or destroying the unpredictable spitting lizards, carnivorous
  coffins, and more.
  .
  Find the concealed weapons needed to defeat everything from eerie phantoms to
  haunted furniture. Then prepare to find yourself face-to-thing with hideous
  torments like the Tongue Lasher, the Darkest Knight, the Bone-Afide Horseman and
  the Granite Crusher. When your nerves get shot, use your password and take a
  breather. But forge on, Simon Belmont, because if you though Dracula was down
  for the count, he's only just begun to fright!

game: Bahamut Lagoon (Japan)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Nintendo/Nintendo Super Famicom/Bahamut Lagoon (Japan)/Bahamut Lagoon (Japan).json
developer: Squaresoft
publisher: Squaresoft
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  Bahamut Lagoon combines RPG mechanics with squad-based combat. Characters have
  HP, MP (SP for fighter characters), EXP, equipment, stats and class-specific,
  SP-draining special elemental abilities very much like traditional console RPGs.
  The player can explore his surroundings, talk to people and visit shops when not
  in battle, though to a limited degree as there is no world map and no way to
  leave the current area.
  .
  The game's core is its turn-based battles fought on a 2d grid. Characters are
  assembled into parties of four and the player allowed a maximum of six parties,
  which are usually well outnumbered. The two opposing sides act in alternating
  turns so that each party can move once and/or attack once a turn. Attacks are
  divided into distant and close-up combat. In the former, a party uses a special
  ability (e.g. casting fireballs, throwing lightning, healing allies) of one of
  its members at a distance. The range and possible area of effect damage vary per
  ability. If the attacking party has two or more characters with the same
  ability, they join in the action to multiply its effectiveness. Distant combat
  results in less money and generally less damage, but the target cannot
  retaliate. Distant attacks can also affect the field; fire and ice ignite or
  extinguish forests and melt or freeze ice, etc. Close-up, each unit in two
  adjacent opposing parties can act once. Very much like Final Fantasy SNES
  combat, they can attack an enemy, use an item or a special ability (though these
  can't be combined and most only affect one target instead of all) or defend.
  .
  Dragons are the player's ace in the hole. They have their own stats and gain
  experience like normal characters do. In battle, each party has a dragon
  attached to it and draws a large portion of its strength from that of its
  dragon: if a party's dragon is slain, the party will lose the ability to use
  special attacks and class-specific abilities for the remainder of the map. The
  beast acts as a very powerful autonomous unit that moves after its party does
  and it cannot be controlled beyond very simple commands, e.g. "Come!" Out of
  battle, dragons will eat anything and raising them by feeding them items is an
  important part of the game. Feeding can improve their stats as well as affect
  their behavior on the field, and the dragons develop into new forms as they
  grow.
  .
  The player can change the characters in each of the parties, their formation as
  well as what dragon represents them at will.

developer: Red Entertainment
publisher: Bullet-Proof Software
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  The magic world of Wozz, populated by magicians, alchemists, and other kinds of
  people - including simple town and village inhabitants - was a seemingly
  peaceful place, until one day, a poisonous rain started turning its inhabitants
  into monsters. The chief wizard realizes that the demon Balaam is trying to link
  the world of Wozz with the world of humans. Only a human hero can stop Balaam,
  and the wizard's teleporting magic brings... three young humans: the Japanese
  girl Reona Kitazato, and two boys: the American Shot Phoenix and the Chinese
  Chun Chingtao. Will those youngsters be able to stop Balaam?
  .
  The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG similar to Breath of Fire:
  turn-based battles are viewed from an isometric perspective. You control all
  three characters as a party, but in the beginning of the game you choose one of
  them as the main character, and therefore will see the game from his/her
  perspective. In case the characters split up, you'll be able to control only the
  one you chose.

game: Cyber Knight (Japan)

developer: Advance Communication Company
publisher: Tonkin House
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship
  Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn
  for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a
  destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The
  Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain.
  Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The
  commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module"
  mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld,
  apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack
  by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish
  must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to
  return home.
  .
  Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien
  galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and
  areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when
  aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning
  worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew
  members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and
  explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which
  can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned
  in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency
  or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts",
  which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts
  unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules
  and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and
  also the six pilots each carry different skills.
  .
  Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the
  side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order
  to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is
  unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are
  consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and
  one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is
  destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first
  aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and
  defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.

  The hero of this game is the son of a brave warrior named Papas. It appears that
  his mother died just after giving birth to him, and his father took him on a
  long journey when he was a little baby, searching for something. Now the boy is
  six years old, and Papas brings him to his hometown. After some time, they learn
  that Henry, the prince of Reinhart, was kidnapped by bandits. Papas and his son
  attempt to rescue him, but this only leads to a tragic event and the boy's
  imprisonment. Only many years later will the hero discover who or what his
  father was searching for, and come to realize his own role in the events that
  dictate the fate of the world.
  .
  Dragon Quest V is a Japanese-style role-playing game with random enemy
  encounters and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Though
  the party only includes three active human combatants, the game allows the
  player to recruit monsters into it. Some of the enemies will randomly request to
  join the party. The player can then add them to the roster and use them in
  battles, where they behave just like any other combatant, using their own
  abilities and even leveling up.
  .
  The game follows the story of Papas' son stretched over many years, from his
  childhood to adulthood. The player will be able to choose a wife for the main
  character from two available female characters. This decision influences some of
  the subsequent events and features. The hero eventually becomes a parent, and
  his new family plays a pivotal role in the plot.

  wisdom and their strength, and lost contact to them, destroying the balance in
  the world. Now, only a few dragons remained, and their whereabouts are shrouded
  in mystery...

  In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives
  in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a
  mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little
  girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name
  is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl
  doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she
  turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon
  after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks
  the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a
  mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among
  the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the
  Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...
  .
  The game has many traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay elements: Atrushan and
  his party travel around the game world, visit towns, descend into dungeons, and
  level up in an automatic fashion. One of the game's distinguishing features is
  its battle system. Characters are able to freely move over the battle field; the
  range of their movement depends on their agility rating. Only Atrushan can be
  given precise instruction during each turn. The player is able to position the
  characters strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different
  sides, and assign general strategies to the party members. Another notable
  feature of the game is the absence of a "world map": the game's locations are
  seamlessly connected with each other.

  In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing
  the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be
  executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The
  group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers.
  On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy,
  while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.
  .
  FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other
  titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party
  of varying size and characters with diverse skills.
  .
  In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns
  moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows
  all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an
  inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary
  according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while
  most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive
  powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from
  the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by
  magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.
  .
  Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other
  statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after
  slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle.
  Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.
  .
  The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the
  landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the
  encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while
  another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color,
  adjust sound volume and rename the party members.
  .
  In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the
  place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles,
  the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end
  of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party
  members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.

developer: Square Co., Ltd.
publisher: Square Co., Ltd.
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Live A Live's story is split across seven seemingly unrelated chapters that can
  be played in any order, based on popular genres such as Western, science
  fiction, and mecha. Each chapter has its own plot, setting, and characters.
  Although the basic gameplay is the same throughout the game, each chapter adds a
  new factor to the basic formula, such as the stealth elements in the ninja
  chapter. After the first seven chapters are completed, two final chapters take
  place to establish the connection between the seven previous and resolve the
  story.

game: Monstania (Japan)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Nintendo/Nintendo Super Famicom/Monstania (Japan)/Monstania (Japan).json
developer: Amccus
publisher: Pack-In-Video
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of
  Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The
  light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized
  what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew
  that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his
  life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he
  firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous
  journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get
  involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle
  against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania!
  .
  "Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs.
  You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to
  the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go
  next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot
  leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to
  the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You
  navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and
  long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points.
  Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately
  after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the
  "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up
  automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain
  locations.

game: Mystic Ark (Japan)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Nintendo/Nintendo Super Famicom/Mystic Ark (Japan)/Mystic Ark (Japan).json
developer: Enix
publisher: Produce
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Seven heroes from seven different Worlds. Seven heroes who were brought to a
  mysterious temple on a remote island and transformed into statues. Seven heroes
  who are chosen to bring harmony back to the universe: Miriene the witch
  (wizard), Lux the tetsujin (a race of iron people), Reeshina the grappler
  (monk), Tokio the ninja, Kamio the ogre, and Mesia the priestess. The seventh
  hero is you, the protagonist of the game - the knight Remeer or the female
  warrior Ferris. Your first task will be to release your companions from the
  statues they are locked in. You must travel to the Cat World and to retrieve an
  important artifact. But your main objective is to visit all the seven Worlds and
  to find seven mystic arks - the items that will re-unite those Worlds and bring
  peace to them.
  .
  "Mystic Ark" is a RPG closely connected to  7th Saga. You travel on overworld
  map, visit towns, buy equipment, and descend into dungeons. The combat is
  turn-based and viewed from a third-person "over-the-shoulder" perspective. The
  battles are not random: the enemies can be seen as white dots on your radar, and
  if you don't want to fight, you can sometimes outrun or avoid them. The game
  also contains elements of pure adventure: often you must investigate objects
  closely and use items from your inventory on them.

description:
  The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood
  trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his
  father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a
  cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure,
  travels, and life in the capital city. Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy:
  he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved,
  Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor,
  which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she
  has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those
  heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact
  pursuing one and the same goal...
  .
  Burning Heroes lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one
  starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest,
  but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also
  find and "unlock" four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The
  gameplay system is similar to other Japanese-style RPGs: you fight random
  enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective,
  like in Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion"
  (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage
  you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can
  summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire
  enemy party.

developer: Square
publisher: Square
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  The Earth is ruled by heavenly powers, who destroy it and create it again every
  4000 years, to end the live of powerful races and to let new ones appear. Many
  years ago, four great races dominated the Earth: the wise Danans, the beautiful
  Mermaids, the proud Reptiles, and the strong Giants. But those races had to give
  place to a newly born race: the humans. During the era of the humans, the
  planet's air has become filled with smog and the water dirty with pollutants.
  The cult of the Rudra have appeared and begun fortelling the end of the world.
  As the 4000 year deadline approaches, three characters each embark on their
  separate yet intertwined quests.
  .
  Sion is a young warrior who wants to take part in a ritual tournament and become
  the strongest of the kingdom. However a capture of one of the Cultists of Rudras
  soon complicates his training.\n
  Surlet is a wise magician who is interested in archeology and history of the
  Earth. He is also a pupil of the famous professor Muench who recently made a
  very important discovery regarding ancient ruins\n
  Riza is a young druid who lives with her grandfather in a quiet village. She was
  born with a mysterious jade on her forehead, and now feels the urge to save the
  world from an inevitable, yet unknown disaster.
  .
  Rudra no Hiho is a turn-based RPG, similar in gameplay and graphics to the
  better known Final Fantasy VI. Whenever players load the game cartridge, they
  are able to choose which of the three characters they wish to play. This allows
  any one of these quests to be saved and put aside for any amount of time,
  allowing the player to change between characters as they so desire. Regardless
  of which character is chosen, the game is displayed as a top-view on the
  overworld and in towns. Players can move around to different locations, search
  treasure chests and talk to townspeople. On the overworld and in dungeons,
  random encounters can occur. During battles the game is displayed from a
  side-view and is turn-based between the player's characters and monsters.
  Players are able to Fight with their weapon, use mantras (magic), use items,
  defend or run away. Defeat of monsters will result in the party earning
  experience points and money, which can be spent to buy new weapons, armor and
  items.
  .
  The game's mantra (magic) system is unique in that all spells are formed up of
  syllables, each with it's own effect (for instance, the syllable "Ig" represents
  fire and the syllable "ga" augments any mantra's power over it's basic form.
  Therefore "Igga" is a more powerful version than "Ig" alone). Syllables must be
  arranged in proper combinations in order to form effective magic spells. Hints
  towards some of these combinations can be found inside treasure chests or by
  talking to townspeople.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Fifty years have passed since the hero of Shin Megami Tensei followed the
  neutral path, defeated the leaders of Law and Chaos, and founded a state where
  followers of both ideologies could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't
  last long. The Messian faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new
  enclosed environment named Tokyo Millennium. The Gaians rise up, but their
  rebellion is repressed by the Messians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights.
  People flock into the encapsulated city, submitting themselves to the strict
  hierarchy imposed by the Messian Center, where only the privileged living in the
  Center district are safe from demonic assaults.
  .
  A few years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto rescues a man named Hawk, who
  was fighting for his life against a demon. He trains him to fight in the arena
  of the Valhalla district, hoping that he would win the tournament, which will
  grant them both citizenship in the Center district. When Hawk succeeds, he is
  brought before a Messian bishop, and learns the shocking truth about his own
  origins and the role he is supposed to play in the grand scheme of events. A new
  battle for a better future begins.
  .
  Shin Megami Tensei II retains all the gameplay features of the previous game.
  The player is able to summon demons, fuse them to create more powerful ones,
  make them participate in battles, talk to random enemies and receive information
  from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and the player explores the complex,
  maze-like dungeons from a first-person perspective view. Like in the first game,

description:
  Fifty years have passed since the hero of Shin Megami Tensei followed the
  neutral path, defeated the leaders of Law and Chaos, and founded a state where
  followers of both ideologies could live freely. But his reign of freedom doesn't
  last long. The Messian faith gains power, expanding the Cathedral into a new
  enclosed environment named Tokyo Millennium. The Gaians rise up, but their
  rebellion is repressed by the Messians' elite warrior class, the Temple Knights.
  People flock into the encapsulated city, submitting themselves to the strict
  hierarchy imposed by the Messian Center, where only the privileged living in the
  Center district are safe from demonic assaults.
  .
  A few years later, a retired arena fighter Okamoto rescues a man named Hawk, who
  was fighting for his life against a demon. He trains him to fight in the arena
  of the Valhalla district, hoping that he would win the tournament, which will
  grant them both citizenship in the Center district. When Hawk succeeds, he is
  brought before a Messian bishop, and learns the shocking truth about his own
  origins and the role he is supposed to play in the grand scheme of events. A new
  battle for a better future begins.
  .
  Shin Megami Tensei II retains all the gameplay features of the previous game.
  The player is able to summon demons, fuse them to create more powerful ones,
  make them participate in battles, talk to random enemies and receive information
  from them, etc. The combat is turn-based, and the player explores the complex,
  maze-like dungeons from a first-person perspective view. Like in the first game,
  the Law, Chaos, and Neutral alignments play an important role: during the course
  of the game, the player will have to make choices that influence the alignment
  of the protagonist, steering the storyline into different directions.

  Torneko (aka Taloon) from Dragon Quest IV was a merchant and treasure hunter
  who always dreamed of owning his own shop. Having defeating the evil along
  with other heroes, he returned to Endor to work peacefully. Some time has
  passed and after growing successful in this town, Torneko grew anxious.
  Hearing rumors one day about a "Mysterious Dungeon", Torneko meets with the
  king to ask permission to set up a new shop, closer to this Mysterious
  Dungeon. By exploring this cavern and returning safely with the prizes,
  Torneko hopes to become the most successful merchant in the world.
  .
  Torneko no Daibōken: Fushigi no Dungeon is a overhead view game similar to
  Hack, what might be called a "dungeon crawl". Torneko must venture into the
  mysterious dungeon gathering treasure. He may equip any weapons and shields
  he finds there, as well as gather up items such as spell scrolls, staffs and
  herbs with a variety of effect. A variety of enemies, familiar to the Dragon
  Quest series, await him. If Torneko successfully exits the dungeon, he is
  able to sell any of the items he has collected. This money then goes to
  improve the quality of his shop and living quarters. As the game progresses,
  Torneko is able to store special items in the vault, which he is then able to
  bring with him on subsequent trips to the dungeon.

description:
  Brothers Red and Blue G. decide to leave their idyllic village in search of
  their long lost father, who left the kids years ago to go treasure hunting.
  Unfortunately, as soon as they begin their quest, they become entangled with a
  mysterious girl on the run from evil monsters who holds the key to the
  resurrection of a great demon. Now its up to the brothers to save the world if
  they ever want to find their father.
  .
  Treasure Hunter G is a top-down RPG in which you control your party of four
  characters as they explore the fantasy/sci-fi game world in search for quests
  and grinding their stats while the plot advances. The game is divided in a
  world-map screen, a top-down "town" mode and a turn-based fight mode in which
  the characters are taken to generic tiled top-down arenas in which they select
  each character and move or attack depending on their action points.
  .
  Enemies can be seen on the map instead of jumping at you at random intervals,
  and you can freely decide whether to engage them or simply circle them around.
  The game uses a combination of hand-drawn sprites and CGI pre-rendered one
  (mostly for the main characters) with a distinct cute or Super Deformed design
  (as usual for most console RPGs).
