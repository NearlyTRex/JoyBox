  Rukifellth, and the Astral Knights, that hold the current crystals. They are
  missing the fire crystal which Bomberman has. It's up to Bomberman and Pommy to
  stop the new evil and retrieve the crystals. Along the way, he meets Lilith, a
  girl apparently working toward the same goal he is. He meets her on many
  occasions.
  .
  Little does Bomberman know that one of the knights is none other than Regulus
  (now under the name Bulzeeb), who still hasn't forgotten their last battle and
  his vow to settle their differences once and for all.

description:
  Like in most racing games, players race down one-way courses consisting of
  streets vaguely based on real-life locations. While racing, they do their best
  to avoid various road hazards such as oncoming traffic and construction. Players
  chose between seven different cars to race with. As in most racing games, the
  car can simulate either an automatic or manual transmission. Automatic increases
  the speed of gear shifts, while players using the manual transmission must
  switch during races. Players who reach first place move on to the next track,
  like in most racing games. Unlike most racing games, there is the option to
  change the music by pressing the music button.

developer: Rare
publisher: Nintendo
genre: Racing
description:
  It's an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger
  Island! After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger
  contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the
  island before his parents return. Along for the ride are the Kremling spy
  Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie),
  pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.
  .
  Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that
  you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons. However, the
  similarities end there. DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses,
  an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and
  planes, and a unique way of racing called the "Silver Coin Challenge". In this
  mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins
  deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).
  .
  The game also features a strategic method of using weapons. Each colored balloon
  on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon
  multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times). This gives
  the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it
  immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version
  of it later.
  .
  Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks,
  they must first be unlocked in the single player game. There are also four
  battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style
  battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and
  another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest
  (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).

  DOOM 64 picks up where all the other DOOM games left off. After tearing through
  space, hell, and wherever else in the previous games, the Space Marine thought
  that the threat of the demons was finally past. Of course, one survived, and it
  is currently reanimating all of the fallen monsters in a last-ditch attempt to
  revitalize their evil mission. The player's task is to finally rid the universe
  of all the crazy hellions, from the dead guy with the pistol to the
  rocket-spewing Cyberdemon.
  .
  The game is very different from the original DOOM; it has larger sprites, pseudo
  3D, new textures, scrolling skies, custom scripting which allows for morphing
  environments, spawning items and new character animations. The levels are
  completely new and the game features the Unmaker weapon and an alternative end
  boss.

developer: KCEO
publisher: Konami
genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Hybrid Heaven takes many elements from standard 3-D action-adventure games, such
  as Tomb Raider. The player can move in any direction, jump, crawl, climb, and
  shoot. The player must solve puzzles by disabling electronic weapons or through
  skillful manoeuvering.\n
  However, when battling a monster (called a "biological weapon" in Hybrid
  Heaven), the game switches to a completely different mode. The player is
  constrained to a small room and can no longer jump, crawl, or climb. The monster
  and the player move around for strategic position in the room. When they are
  close enough, and have built up enough energy, one or the other will decide to
  attack. At that point time freezes and a single round similar to a role-playing
  video game turn ensues: the attacker picks an attack from a list, the defender
  picks a defense, and the results are displayed. After the attack, both monster
  and player return to jockeying for position in realtime. All of this can happen
  within seconds, which keeps the action flowing more naturally than in most RPGs.

  Super Mario 64 is the first Mario game done entirely with 3D graphics. The core
  gameplay is similar to previous platform installments, focusing on jumping,
  avoiding obstacles and defeating enemies. Levels can be explored without time
  limits. Stars must be collected in order to unlock new areas, eventually gaining
  access to various parts of Bowser's castle. Defeating Bowser on each floor
  procures keys necessary to unlock big doors and enter other floors, which
  contain more areas.
  .
  Mario has more moves at his disposal in this installment. Besides running and
  jumping, he can now walk, crouch, crawl, climb, and punch enemies. Double and
  triple jumps, long jumps, wall jumps and backflips can be executed as well.
  Swimming underwater now depletes Mario's oxygen level. Items must be picked up
  and carried in some instances in order to solve puzzles.
  .
  Power-ups include the Wing Cap, which allows Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, which
  protects him from damage (including environmental hazards such as poisonous
  gas); and the Vanish Cap, which makes Mario ethereal, allowing him to walk
  through certain obstacles (such as wire mesh). Mario can also enter cannons and
  be shot from them; combining this with the flying ability grants access to high

  Controls are analogue-based, with different moves executed depending on the
  direction and how firmly the stick is pressed. Items like baseball bats,
  Bob-ombs, and healing items drop into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby
  characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed viewpoint which
  scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D.
  .
  The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do
  battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden
  characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus rounds, and a battle to
  the end with a giant hand.
