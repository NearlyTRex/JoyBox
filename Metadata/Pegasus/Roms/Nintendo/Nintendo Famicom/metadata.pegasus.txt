  1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Nevada desert has
  turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By
  shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into
  zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work.
  These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were
  more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of
  the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set
  off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and
  knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil
  clutches of Darc Seed.

  Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is
  poised to bury mankind in a Tomb of Terror. Destroying this legion of Swamp
  Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme
  challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years
  before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more
  than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor -
  Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosones. Trevor has
  a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three
  different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic
  Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's
  body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate
  Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe,
  Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is
  your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him
  past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of
  Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and
  Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And
  if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a
  legend who'll live forever!

developer: Atlus
publisher: Namco
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  A high-school student and skillful computer programmer named Akemi Nakajima
  created a software called "Devil Summoning Program". At first Nakajima intended
  to use the software to gain revenge on a classmate who bullied him. However,
  things went out of control, and the malicious demon Loki was unleashed into the
  world. Soon, a demonic invasion of the Earth began. Aided by the lovely Yumiko
  Shirasagi, a transfer student who seems to be interested in him, Nakajima
  decides to undo his wrongs and defeat the demons. In order to do that, the young
  couple will need to learn how to use the program for good purposes, and uncover
  the truth about their own previous incarnations.
  .
  Based on a series of horror novels by the Japanese author Aya Nishitani (the
  first of which is named Digital Devil Story), Megami Tensei (translated as
  "Goddess Reincarnation") marks the birth of the eponymous role-playing
  franchise. The game is a first-person RPG with turn-based combat, set entirely
  in large, maze-like dungeon areas. Unlike in most Japanese-style RPGs, the
  player can manually increase combat parameters of Nakajima and Yumiko when they
  gain a level.
  .
  The game introduces the demon summoning feature that has since become the
  distinguishing gameplay element of the series. The player is able to communicate
  with randomly encountered demons through Nakajima's computer software, summon
  them, and make them fight as members of the controlled party. Communications
  with randomly encountered demons usually involve offering them money or
  magnetite (energy they consume); the outcome of the communication depends on the
  demon's race, alignment, and the phase of the moon. Demons can also be "fused"
  with each other in special facilities, creating more powerful species.

  Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed

  stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways
  to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped
  with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them
  of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health
  until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The
  hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of
  such a feature to action games.

developer: Namco

genre: Action
description:
  The Tower of Druaga is a maze-based action role-playing game from Namco, created
  on the Mappy engine and originally released in Arcades in 1984 and later ported
  to consoles such as the NES, Game Boy and MSX as well as appearing in numerous
  Namco compilations, such as Namco Museum Vol. 3 for the PlayStation in 1997. The
  game is the first in the Babylonian Castle Saga and second chronologically. In
  1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed
  below.
  .
  Combining hack & slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid
  the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and
  Hydlide. Its hack & slash combat included the ability to both attack with a
  sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still.
  It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs
  such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also
  debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon
  Quest series.
  .
  The game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of
  Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The
  anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game. A noteworthy element of
  the anime is the music, composed by famed video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.

developer: Game Studio
publisher: Namco
genre: Racing
description:
  Family Circuit is a racing game for Nintendo's Family Computer, hence the name.
  Unlike other Nintendo racing games at the time, it has many realistic traits,
  removing itself from the main crop of more arcade oriented titles. The car can
  be customized to your heart's content, with different tires, wings and
  suspension and detailed engine settings for both turbo and torque.
  .
  Four racing modes are available:
  .
  - Free run: Run any way you want around the track, getting to know both the
  curves and straights as well as the settings of your car.\n
  - Sprint race: Race a season in four classes – novice, B class, A class and
  Super A – around well-known (Fuji, Suzuka) and less well-known tracks (Family
  Park, Namcot-ring), competing for the first place.\n
  - Endurance race: Run around and around a track to see who gives up last.\n
  - Spectator mode: Not a real racing mode, but allows you to follow any car in
  any class around any track.
  .
  As you bump into things or push the car too far, you must pit in, where you will
  be given statistics for each part of the car and may choose to fix it. Some of
  this realism is however forfeited by the fact that cars can never collide.
  Racing straight through an opponent with both cars undamaged is perfectly
  possible.

description:
  Family Jockey is a horse racing game for the Famicom. You can choose between one
  player or two player simultaneous mode. At the start you must choose a horse.
  Horses have different skill levels like speed, stamina or jump. During the race
  the horses and the course are displayed from a top-down view. You increase the
  speed of your horse by using your whip, which in return results in an energy
  decrease, so it must be used with care. There are two different surface types
  (lawn and dirt) and some courses have obstacles that you have to jump over. You
  must place at least in the top 4 of each race to continue with the game. Placing
  higher increases the prize money. Besides a mode that concentrates purely on the
  racing part you can choose a so called "Family Game" which includes a betting
  part in addition to the racing.

  When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an

  magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil
  magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to
  use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other
  magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder.
  Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever
  created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them
  far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a
  great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great
  War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of
  their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank,
  even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in
  this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician,
  making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the
  weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will
  threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the
  world from his scourge of evil!

description:
  The Quest of Ki (カイの冒険 Kai no Bōken?) is a 1988 video game developed by Game
  Studio and published by Namco for the Family Computer. It is the third game in
  Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower
  of Druaga.
  .
  The story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of
  Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod
  and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the
  tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top
  of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game.
  .
  The game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level,
  the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next
  area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each
  floor, and any contact with them results in death.
  .
  Ki has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her
  only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button
  down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling
  will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds.
  .
  Many of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully
  regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains
  one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items
  bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were
  found.
  .
  After completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These
  stages contain cameos from the Pac-Man ghosts and the enemies from Dig Dug.

description:
  The player must take control of a man known only as Runner, who is given a time
  limit to run through each of the game's thirty-two rounds while avoiding
  obstacles and collecting drink cans. The actual running happens automatically:
  the job of the player is to avoid the obstacles and collect the cans by moving
  the Runner with the stick and adjusting his speed accordingly.
  .
  If the Runner finishes the round within the time limit, the remaining time will
  be awarded to him as bonus points and he will proceed to the next round. Every
  fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous ones
  as additional time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round by the
  time the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game will
  immediately be over.
  .
  Obstacles along the way include Slip Zones which will slow the Runner down if he
  tries to cross over them, Pitfalls which will break under the Runner's weight
  and drop him into the holes beneath them, and Crackers which will launch the
  Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also
  feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards the Runner, Walls that emerge from the
  ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns
  of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down, and Chess
  Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.
  .
  The rounds also feature Springboards, which can be used to propel the Runner
  forward at a great speed. Some rounds have a special layout of Springboards,
  where it is possible to use one Springboard to land directly on the second one.
  Some other rounds also feature Skateboards which will speed the Runner up and
  make him immune to Slip Zones. There are also two different types of drink cans;
  kicking them will either gain the player bonus points (from 100 to 5000) or
  speed the Runner up, but jumping on them will stop the timer for a few seconds.

  Once again, inhabitants from the planet Xevious, controlled by the
  super-computer GAMP, are attacking the Earth, their ancient home planet, willing
  to re-capture it by force. The SOL towers have emerged from the ground on our
  planet, remotely controlled by GAMP, aiding the Xevians in their invasion. Only
  the brave pilots of the Solvalou aircraft are able to avert this new threat!
  .
  Super Xevious is a 2D vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up. Power-ups such as
  bombs, lasers, and shields can be collected; the latter protects the aircraft
  from immediate destruction if hit by an enemy. Other power-ups for the Solvalou
  include a rear shot and a bigger lock-on. Some stages are completed by
  fulfilling certain requirements, rather than simply proceeding, eliminating all
  enemies; if these are not met, the stage will loop indefinitely, sending
  progressively harder enemies. These objectives typically include locating and
  destroying a number of SOL towers; the target sight will flash when it goes over
  these structures.

description:
  Tenkaichi Bushi: Keru Naguuru is a one-on-one martial arts fighting game set
  in ancient China.
  .
  Using 2D side-scrolling graphics with a distinct cartoony design, the player
  takes control of a single fighter as he attempts to defeat his opponent in
  single-round fights. Combat is controlled with a single attack button which
  can unleash all sorts of moves when pressed in conjunction with the
  directional arrows. These moves vary among each fighter, as players can
  choose from 15 different fighters, each with their own stats and moves, and
  then compete against the others to see who gets the honor of becoming
  grandmaster.
  .
  Additionally the game includes a story mode in which players can take control
  of a single martial artist and roam the countryside looking for challengers
  (the later done from a top-down map view). Starting abilities and health are
  minimal, but successfully defeating opponents will increase the player's
  health and allow the fighter to learn new moves and turn into the ultimate
  combatant.

  Once upon a time, the Marvel Land was a peaceful place populated by humans and
  other races. Zouna, a dark wizard who had once threatened the land was securely
  sealed in a clock tower. One day, the clock stopped working for unknown reason,
  and a villager who tried to fix it inadvertently dropped the key of time. A
  catastrophe ensued: Zouna broke free and took the key with him, preventing
  anyone from sealing him again. The dark minions of Zouna corrupted the hearts of
  Marvel Land inhabitants. Hatred and chaos descended upon the world. Finally, a
  savior has arrived - Valkyrie, a maiden from heaven vows to save Marvel Land
  from evil and defeat Zouna.
  .
  Valkyrie no Bōken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu is an action role-playing game.
  Controlling Valkyrie, the player roams top-down wilderness areas, fighting
  enemies and collecting gold and experience points, which will eventually cause
  the heroine to level up and become stronger. Weapons and armor can be purchased
  in friendly areas or found during exploration. Valkyrie also gains access to
  seven different spells of offensive and healing nature. The time needed to learn
  the spell depends on the protagonist's intelligence parameter. The player's
  initial choice of star sign and blood group for the heroine may affect the
  changes in her statistics when she levels up.

developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
genre: Shooter
description:
  This game is an updated version of Warp Warp. Players once again take control of
  the monster fighter as he does battle with various types of enemy Beroberos.
  .
  The game features two types of gameplay. First, players start out in the Space
  World. Players control the monster fighter from a top down perspective. The
  player is equipped with a weapon that can be used to fire at the enemy monsters.
  The monster fighter can only walk in the four cardinal directions and thus only
  fire straight forward in whatever direction he is currently facing. The
  objective is to eliminate all the enemy monsters from the playfield to clear a
  level. Also, eliminating three monsters of the same type and color in a row,
  will cause a special monster to appear which can be shot for bonus points.
  Sometimes these special monsters will carry one letter of the word EXTRA.
  Collecting all five letters of that word will give the player an extra life.
  .
  In the center of the Space World is a warp tunnel that will occasionally flash
  when active. Entering an active warp tunnel will lead the player to the Maze
  World.
  .
  The Maze World portion of the game is similar in nature to Bomberman. Players
  walk along grid based corridors, planting time bombs attempting to eliminate any
  enemy monsters who happen to have had the misfortune of stumbling upon them.
  .
  Players will have the opportunity to warp out of either world at random
  intervals. However, they are not required to leave the current world they are
  in, and they can continue playing in that world type if they so choose to.

description:
  The player controls a boy named Tarosuke, who travels through "Jigoku" (the
  Japanese concept of Hell) fighting off "yokai" (mythical Japanese monsters) on
  his way to his final fate, as determined by Buddha. He destroys his enemies by
  firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however,
  if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During
  boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning
  "Monmotaro" (not to be confused with "Momotarō"), a spirit which floats in the
  air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is
  defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.

  Final Fantasy VII is an unlicensed "Shanzhai" demake of SquareSoft's
  role-playing game of the same name, originally released for PlayStation in
  1997. This two-dimensional "port" was developed and published by Chinese
  company Shenzhen Nanjing Technology for Subor, a Nintendo's Family Computer
  clone console series (internationally known as the NES). The cartridge itself
  is unique, as it is structurally different from licensed Famicom cartridges
  in terms of hardware and programming.
  .
  The title features many gameplay elements of the original counterpart,
  including a three-member party structure and adaptations of the game's
  subsystems. Items, spells and equipment available to the player are based
  upon those in the original game, and although a large number have been
  omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original
  story was reproduced in very minute detail. Its receptions were mixed, cited
  as an impressive achievement but at the same time criticized for the
  difficulty and choice of a target console.
