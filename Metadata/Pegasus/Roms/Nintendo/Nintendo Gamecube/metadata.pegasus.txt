developer: EA Redwood Shores
publisher: Electronic Arts
genre: Shooter
description:
  007: Agent Under Fire is the first James Bond game to appear on the PlayStation
  2, GameCube, and Xbox. The game casts the player as the legendary James Bond who
  must accomplish missions throughout different areas of the world. Bond is sent
  on a mission rescue Zoe Nightshade, a CIA agent in the hands of Nigel Bloch.
  Nigel Bloch is the CEO of Identicon, a section of a highly successful industry
  company known as Malprave industries. Bond is also tasked to retrieve the set of
  DNA samples that are in Identicon's hands. So James Bond sets off on another
  adventure...
  .
  The game combines three game modes into one package: first-person-shooter, which
  is what most of the missions are, a rail-shooter, where the player only controls
  firing, and a driving game, where the player drives one of the many Bond cars.
  Numerous weapons have been added to the series, along with some fictional
  weapons like the Photon cannon and the 5-way grenade launcher. The player can
  utilize a wide array of gadgets and weapons, like the Q-Claw, Q-Decoder, and
  Bond's trusty Walther handgun. There is a large variety of missions, and Bond
  can go through most missions with weapons, or take a stealthy approach. The
  player is also rated in each level, based on score and difficulty level, and can
  unlock new features for both single and multiplayer.

game: Darkened Skye (USA)

developer: Boston Animation
publisher: Simon & Schuster Interactive
genre: Action;Adventure;Role-Playing
description:
  In the action-oriented 3D role-playing game Darkened Skye, the player takes the
  role of the title character and embarks on a quest to collect four prisms that
  may help bring the light of goodness back to the world. Skye of Lynlora was just
  a restless shepherd when she first came across the strange item that would
  change her life forever. Now she has opened a portal to another place and chaos
  has come forth. Only Skye can set things right once again. She will face an
  assortment of fantasy characters and creatures in her journeys as she makes her
  way through 30 missions set across five different game worlds. It is notable
  that, like some other releases from publisher Simon and Schuster (including the
  Boston Animation-developed M&M's: The Lost Formulas), this game features
  prominent product placement in the form of Skittles brand fruit-flavored
  candies. Indeed, it is the mystic power of Skittles that moves Skye through more
  than one threatening game situation. In spite of any potential incongruities of
  featuring a familiar consumer item in a fantasy world, Darkened Skye strives to
  provide the graphical competence, engrossing story, and state-of-the-art play
  that gamers expect from a major 2002 release. ~ T.J. Deci, All Game Guide

  button to jump, unlike the GameCube version which required the player to beat
  the bongos to do both. This is the first game to be rated E10 by the ESRB.

description:
  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem is a psychological horror action adventure,
  released in 2002 by Nintendo for the Gamecube. It tells the stories of twelve
  characters that span across the world and two millennia who have to deal with
  ancient forces of evil which have been trying to manifest themselves in our
  world. Chapters take place in Ancient Rome, Persia, the Middle East, and
  modern-day Rhode Island. Throughout the game, the protagonists will have access
  to several weapons appropriate for their era, from bastard sword & gladius to
  flintlock pistol and shotgun.
  .
  The game features an involved Magic system, which allows different spells to be
  created through the combination of runes. These spells can attack enemies,
  dispel illusions, and heal both the body and items.
  .
  Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem also has a unique feature called Sanity. If
  an enemy sees a character, their Sanity meter drops. When Sanity gets low,
  hallucinations begin to plague the character. Walls bleed, voices whisper from
  nowhere, the camera gets disoriented. Sanity can be restored by dealing a
  finishing move on a dying enemy, or with spells or some items.

  The game begins with the land of Hyrule in a state of fear because of strange

  weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her
  and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary.
  When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears from the portal. This figure was
  Shadow Link, who then kidnapped the shrine maidens and sealed them in crystals.
  Link follows him to the sanctuary where he retrieves the Four Sword to destroy
  this doppelganger. The Four Sword is a magical sword that splits the wielder
  into three clones of himself. Vaati is once again released and wreaks havoc on
  the once peaceful kingdom.

genre: Action;Adventure
description:
  The game is set on a group of islands in a vast sea—a first for the series. The
  player controls Link, the protagonist of the Zelda series. He struggles against
  his nemesis, Ganondorf, for control of a sacred relic known as the Triforce.
  Link spends a large portion of the game sailing, traveling between islands, and
  traversing through dungeons and temples to gain the power necessary to defeat
  Ganondorf. He also spends time trying to find his little sister.\n
  The Wind Waker follows in the footsteps of Ocarina of Time and its sequel
  Majora's Mask, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the two
  Nintendo 64 titles. A heavy emphasis is placed on using and controlling wind
  with a baton called the Wind Waker, which aids sailing and floating in air.
  Controversial during development for its use of cel shading graphics and younger
  Link character, The Wind Waker received acclaim on release and is one of the
  Nintendo GameCube's most popular games.

description:
  Sonic Gems Collection is a compilation presented in a similar style to the prior
  collection in the Sonic series, Sonic Mega Collection. However, as its name
  suggests, Gems Collection contains more rare and obscure games from the Sonic
  series. The main games included are Sonic CD, Sonic R, and Sonic the Fighters.
  Several Sonic Game Gear games are also included. The Japanese version contains
  the Streets of Rage trilogy but the North American release replaces these with
  the two Vectorman games to prevent the game being given a harsher rating. Also
  included is an "Extras" feature where players can look at illustrations and
  promotional material for the Sonic games and play demos of some of the Sonic
  games featured in Mega Collection.

genre: Action;Fighting
description:
  Super Smash Bros. Melee differs from traditional fighting games in that
  inflicting the most damage does not guarantee victory. Instead, opposing players
  must force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks
  inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each
  character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as
  a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets
  knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage. Unlike other games
  of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most
  moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a
  joystick direction.

description:
  Following the almost universally acclaimed short-attention-span action of the
  Game Boy Advance's WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$! comes this party-game
  adaptation for GameCube. Many of the mini-games featured in the handheld
  original have been converted for four-player competition on the console. Gamers
  strive to be the quickest teeth-brushers, the most precise nose pickers, the
  best free-throwers, the most accurate apple shooters, the most skillful
  paper-airplane pilots, and the victors in countless other quick contests that
  take no more than a few seconds to complete.
  .
  As in the GBA original, a wide variety of activities combine with a simple,
  unifying theme, for an experience designed to appeal instantly to anyone who
  played video games in the days before 3D graphics and complicated storylines.
  Half the fun is in not knowing which five-second challenge will pop up next, or
  what the player will be required to do in it. Even when players aren't in
  control of the active character, some of the mini-games allow them to
  participate in a more passive fashion, adding to the group-oriented strategy.
