description:
  You have inherited the family ranch from an ancestor. With only a shed of rusted
  tools and a small amount of money, you must prove yourself worthy of owning the
  ranch by returning it to its former glory. To do this, you must till the soil
  and cultivate vegetables. When you have earned enough money, you can add
  chickens and livestock to help increase your profits. While you work, you will
  receive visits from the local townsfolk, who will ask for your help. You should
  always help them as much as possible, because they will be willing to return the
  favor later. Once you have built your ranch to a significant level, you can
  trade it with other farm masters via link cable. Try to restore the family ranch
  in HARVEST MOON.
