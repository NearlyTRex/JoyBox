  Atooi Collection was Limited Run Games' 001 release on Nintendo 3DS, which went
  live August 7, 2020. Only 6000 copies were made.
  .
  A single cartridge features the following critically-acclaimed games: Mutant
  Mudds Deluxe, Bomb Monkey, Xeodrifter, Mutant Mudds Super Challenge, and Chicken
  Wiggle.
  .
  Ever since we first released Mutant Mudds in 2012, we have dreamed of releasing
  it physically on Nintendo 3DS. Due to the high cost and risky nature of the
  retail business, this dream seemed as though it would never come true.
  .
  When Limited Run Games reached out to us with interest in publishing our games
  physically on Nintendo 3DS, we were floored. We are very grateful to Josh,
  Douglas, and the rest of the team for having faith in our games to release them
  physically on Nintendo 3DS.
  .
  Atooi Collection represents our deep appreciation of retro pixel games, and we
  are thrilled to have them all featured in one amazing collection. The time we
  spent creating these five games were magical and fun for us. We hope you have as
  much fun playing them as we did making them!

  Kirby's Epic Yarn is a platform video game developed by Good-Feel and HAL
  Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Wii video game console. It is the
  tenth installment of the Kirby series and was released in October 2010 in Japan
  and North America and in February 2011 in Australia and Europe. It is the first
  entry in the Kirby series on a home console since 2003's Kirby Air Ride and its
  first home console platform game since 2000's Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards.
  .
  The game follows Kirby, who has been transformed into yarn and sent to Patch
  Land, a world made completely out of fabric. He must help Prince Fluff by
  collecting seven pieces of magic yarn that are used to stitch Patch Land
  together in order to stop the game's antagonist, Yin Yarn. Kirby's Epic Yarn
  utilizes a unique craft-based visual style; the game's characters and
  environments consist entirely of yarn, fabric, and other craft materials. Unlike
  most games in the Kirby series, Kirby is unable to inhale or fly, instead
  relying on the ability to morph into other objects, such as a parachute, a car,
  and a submarine, as well as larger objects such as a tank and a steam train.
  .
  The third game developed by Good-Feel in tandem with Nintendo, Kirby's Epic Yarn
  was originally proposed by Madoka Yamauchi, who came up with the idea of a
  "world of yarn" as a video game. It began development as "Keito no Fluff", a
  game starring Prince Fluff as the main protagonist, before the starring
  character was eventually switched to Kirby. The game's graphical style was
  created via digital images of real-life fabrics which were placed over polygons.
  The game's music was composed by Tomoya Tomita.
  .
  Before the game's release, Kirby's Epic Yarn won numerous awards at E3 2010
  including Game of the Show from GameSpot. It was released later that year to
  largely positive reviews, receiving an Editor's Choice award from IGN, who
  ranked it as #95 in their "Top 100 Modern Games". As of April 2011, it has sold
  1.59 million copies worldwide. It was re-released digitally via the Wii U eShop
  in Europe and Australia on May 21, 2015, in North America on July 28, 2016, and
  in Japan on August 9, 2016. A spiritual successor to Kirby's Epic Yarn titled
  Yoshi's Woolly World was released in 2015 for the Wii U. A port of the game for
  the Nintendo 3DS entitled Kirby's Extra Epic Yarn was released on March 8, 2019.

  Super Mario 3D Land is a platform game that has been described by game designer
  Shigeru Miyamoto as a "3D Mario that plays as a 2D Mario game." As such, Super
  Mario 3D Land combines the elements of traditional side-scrolling Mario titles,
  such as linear-based levels, with those of the modern open world Mario titles,
  such as moving Mario in three dimensions and performing a variety of actions.
  .
  Similar to the classic side-scrolling Mario games, the objective of each level
  is to reach and grab the "Goal Pole" located at the end of the course before the
  time limit expires. Super Mario 3D Land utilizes a similar health system to
  those games, in which Mario shrinks upon taking damage from enemies or hazards,
  and damage while as "Small Mario" results in losing a life.

  the beloved franchise. The series’ fun game-play mechanics such as Yoshi’s
  Flutter Jump, Ground Pound and Egg Throw return, but now Yoshi knows a ton of
  new tricks too. Yoshi gets to bash and thrash his environment by throwing around
  Mega Eggdozers and Metal Eggdozers. Yoshi also can transform into a variety of
  objects, such as a jackhammer or a submarine, both of which can be manipulated
  using the Nintendo 3DS gyro controls. A certain type of star even transforms him
  into Super Yoshi, giving him the ability to fly through the sky or run along
  walls and ceilings. Players who are having trouble completing a level might see
  the appearance of Flutter Wings, which let Yoshi fly through the air.
