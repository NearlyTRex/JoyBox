  Daikatana is a Role-Playing game, developed by Ion Storm and published by Kemco.
  The Game Boy Color version of Daikatana was only released in Europe; Kemco
  decided against the North American and Japanese release due to the poor
  reputation of the Daikatana brand. This version's gameplay differs greatly from
  the N64 and PC versions. At John Romero's request, the title was adapted to the
  platform as a top-down dungeon crawler, in the style of early Zelda games such
  as the NES original and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.

description:
  In a rising pit of colored blocks, it's your task to continuously eliminate
  these tiles by switching two tiles' positions on the horizontal row. When three
  or more tiles link up in a up/down or left/right fashion, they disappear.
  Gravity kicks in and settles the rest of the tiles into the bin ? this can cause
  a chain reaction to occur since other blocks of the same color can fall into
  place next to each other. It's up to you to continuously work the bin to wipe
  out tiles by making combination connections and chain reactions. That's the game
  in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers
  busy. In the game's Challenge mode, for example, you're up against a computer
  opponent and you'll have to make combos and chain reactions to send garbage
  blocks to his unseen screen -- but keep in mind your opponent's doing the same
  to you.

  Printer. Compared to Super Mario Bros., the game features a few minor visual
  upgrades such as water and lava now being animated rather than static, and a
