  Donkey Kong returns to Game Boy! This famous ape has kidnapped Pauline and
  climbed to the top of a perilous skyscraper.
  .
  Challenged by many perils and unending puzzles, Mario must reach his arch rival.
  As he makes his way Mario will need to gather disappearing keys to unlock doors
  of hidden rooms. Donkey Kong devises evil tricks to confuse and trap him. Our
  heroic plumber has his hands full this time!
  .
  Donkey Kong is a platform game developed in 1994 by Nintendo for the Game Boy
  handheld video game system, which also contains puzzle elements. Donkey Kong is
  loosely based on the 1981 arcade game of the same name and its sequel Donkey
  Kong Jr. The game was known under the working title Donkey Kong '94 before the
  release.
  .
  Like in the original arcade and NES version, the player takes control of Mario
  and must rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong (who are both given updated character
  designs for this game). Donkey Kong Jr. makes a guest appearance in the game on
  some levels, helping his father hinder Mario's progress.\n
  This was the first Game Boy title designed with enhanced features when played on
  the Super Game Boy. It features gameplay elements from Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong
  Jr., and Super Mario Bros. 2.

description:
  An egg arrives from a far-off planet in outer space. This egg contains a
  'Tamagotchi', a baby alien that cannot fend for itself, and requires your
  attention and care. Look after the Tamagotchi and help it grow up.
  .
  Tamagotchi is a game based on the popular virtual pet of the same name. In it,
  you select an egg from the laboratory, and then it hatches in its room. From
  there, you are fully responsible for its care. Everything from feeding,
  medicine, playing with it, cleaning up its poo and scolding or praising it when
  appropriate - you must do it all.
  .
  Unlike the actual Tamagotchi toy, the Game Boy version is not in realtime - you
  can adjust the Tamagotchi's growth speed in the game options. You can also look
  after up to three Tamagotchis simultaneously. The Game Boy version also features
  three different games to play with your pet - depending on the game you select,
  it will improve their mood, their intelligence, or their physical fitness. The
  three games are:
  .
  Smile Game - Your pet will look left and right. Try to guess which direction it
  will face next.\n
  Study Game - Help your Tamagotchi study. Simple math questions will appear and
  you must help it answer them.\n
  Sports Game - Keep your Tamagotchi fit. Baseballs will rain down from the sky.
  Get your pet to them before they hit the floor to score a point.
  .
  Another feature exclusive to the Game Boy version are Tournaments. You can enter
  your pet in Race, Beauty and Knowledge tournaments. You can increase your
  chances of winning in these by training your pet, but make sure that when you
  enter them that it's not sick or spoiled, as it will not perform as well as it
  could. Win a tournament and your Tamagotchi will be placed in the Hall of Fame.
