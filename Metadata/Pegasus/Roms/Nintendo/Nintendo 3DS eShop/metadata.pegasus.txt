  Ecco the Dolphin is an action-adventure game originally developed by Ed
  Annunziata and Novotrade International for the Sega Genesis and published by
  Sega in 1992.
  .
  It is the first installment in the Ecco the Dolphin video game franchise. The

  hostile extraterrestrials in Earth's oceans and on an alien spacecraft.
  .
  3D Ecco the Dolphin is a port of the game for the Nintendo 3DS as part of Sega's
  3D Classics line. Along with stereoscopic 3D graphics and the option to choose
  between Japanese and international versions of the game, the port also adds
  'Super Dolphin Mode', which decreases the difficulty by giving players
  invincibility and unlimited oxygen. The game was released on the Nintendo eShop
  in Japan on June 26, 2013, and in North America and Europe on December 12, 2013.

description:
  Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa-Opa is the sequel to Fantasy Zone, in which
  you control Opa-Opa, a pretty colored ship with wings on its side. You must
  destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your
  task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you
  destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up
  and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way
  shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of
  enemies all in a row.
  .
  More often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a
  dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the
  land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate
  in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you
  must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the
  original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend
  money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).

developer: Sega AM2

genre: Racing
description:
  3D third-person racing game. The player controls a car, a Ferrari Testarossa
  Spider, from a rear third-person perspective. In contrast to other third-person
  racing games at the time where the camera is some distance above the horizon to
  see into the distance, Out Run places the camera near the ground, directly
  behind the car, simulating a Ferrari driver's perspective view and limiting the
  player's view into the distance.The road also curves and dips,which, combined
  with the low perspective, increases the challenge by making it difficult to see
  what is on the other side of a hill.
  .
  The player must race to the end of each stage as fast as possible against a time
  limit while avoiding traffic. At the end of each stage, the player is presented
  with a fork in the road where the player must choose one of two stages. The left
  route presents an easier stage, while the right offers a greater challenge.
  Passing through checkpoints awards the player with extra time. Once the timer
  reaches zero or the player completes the race, the game ends. In addition to the
  nonlinear gameplay, Out Run also offered the choice of music to listen to while
  driving, represented as radio stations.

genre: Action;Platformer;2D
description:
  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is a side-scrolling platformer based around speed, and the
  sequel to Sonic the Hedgehog. Like the original, players run through different
  worlds called "zones", which each have their own specific theme. There are two
  Acts in nearly all of the 10 Zones, and at the end of each Zone's last Act is a
  machine that Robotnik controls, which you must defeat to progress. The evil Dr.
  Robotnik wants to conquer the world. In order to do that, he imprisons and
  transforms all animals into robots called "Badniks". This way they can build his
  powerful weapon, the Death Egg. Only Sonic the Hedgehog, and his new tagalong
  partner, Miles 'Tails' Prower, can stop Robotnik and his army of Badniks from
  taking over the world.
  .
  Sonic and Tails can collect rings which are scattered throughout all of the
  levels. As with most platformers, when the player collects 100 rings, they earn
  an extra life. However, the rings also act as protection; if Sonic is hurt when
  he is carrying rings, they scatter everywhere and he is briefly invincible. If
  he is hit again when he has no rings, he'll lose a life. If the player reaches a
  continue point lamppost with 50 or more rings, they'll be able to access the
  Special Stage. In this stage, you must gather a set amount of rings in a
  halfpipe-like stage before you reach a checkpoint. Complete all the checkpoints
  and you'll earn one of the seven Chaos Emeralds.
  .
  New to Sonic the Hedgehog 2 is the ability to play the game co-op with a friend
  - at any time, a player can plug in a second controller and take over the AI
  controlled Tails. Tails has infinite lives and the camera remains focused on
  Sonic, meaning that Tails will not hinder play. Sonic (and Tails) can now also
  get speed from a standing start by holding down and repeatedly pressing the jump
  button for a "spin dash". This is useful when stuck near steep slopes or other
  areas where you need some momentum. The game also features a 2-player versus
  mode. This mode is a horizontally split-screen race through levels based on
  three of the zones in the single player game.
  .
  The mobile version (iOS/Android) contains ten new levels in a new environment
  called Hidden Palace Zone, a boss attack mode, upgraded graphics, faster frame
  rate, a re-mastered soundtrack, and Knuckles as a third playable character.

  BoxBoy! is a platform game in which players control a box-shaped character named

  come from Qbby's ability to spawn boxes out of his body, the number of which
  varies between each level. These boxes can spread out in whatever direction is
  possible to make various shapes and can either be carried or thrown and pushed
  around. The boxes have various uses, such as allowing players to reach high
  ledges or cross large gaps, holding down switches, or blocking deadly lasers.
  Additionally, by hooking these boxes onto a ledge while Qbby is still attached,
  he can pull himself up.

  Cave Story is a re-release of the original Cave Story and meant to replace the
  2010 DSi version. As technical limitations prevented it from being provided as a
  free update, it was released as a new game. This version does not incorporate
  the re-drawn look of the 2010 Wii version or the 2011 PC version Cave Story+,
  nor does it carry over the very different 3D makeover from the 2011 3DS game
  Cave Story 3D. The game was reworked to fit the higher 5:3 widescreen screen
  size and has the stereoscopic 3D effect. This makes it easier to distinguish
  elements in busy environments, but optionally it can be scaled back to the
  original 4:3 resolution.
  .
  Contentwise there are a few small tweaks. The in-game map is no longer visible
  at the bottom of the screen all the time, encouraging the player not to rely on
  it too much. It is also possible to customize the controls, flipping jump and
  shoot buttons for instance. The game incorporates the additional content of the
  WiiWare and + version with the modes Boss Rush, Curly Story, and Sanctuary Time
  Attack (WiiWare and Cave Story+ versions) and the new unlockable Wind Fortress
  area with the new enemies and bosses, and the Nemesis Challenge (Cave Story+).
  It includes the reindeer and vampire sprite swaps from the WiiWare version, but
  not the holiday themed content from Cave Story+. It also contains the jukebox
  option from the DSi version.

developer: Vanpool

genre: Action
description:
  On the dusty plains of the new frontier, fearsome rock monsters are attacking
  the villages and stealing their livestock. It's up to Dillon, an armadillo out
  for justice, to set the world to rights. If he can defend a village from the
  rocky threat for three days, then his work is done and he can hit the road for
  the next town.
  .
  Dillon's Rolling Western is a tower defence game divided into two segments.
  During the day, the player-controlled Dillon can explore the local area to look
  for resources to sell and use the money to build up the village's defences, as
  well as run errands for the villagers. During the night, the rock monsters
  arrive to attack the village, so to support the defences he's built up, Dillon
  will fight them by rolling into a ball and charging at them. The player can roll
  Dillon into a ball using the touch screen and control his direction while
  rolling using the circle pad. Upon impact, they can either hold for a grinding
  attack or tap to start a combo.
  .
  Once Dillon has successfully held the rock monsters back for three days, he is
  free to move on to another village.

description:
  Dillon, an armadillo, is a ranger charged with protecting villages from nightly
  invasions of walking rock monsters called Grocks. The Grocks attack the villages
  to feed on Scrogs, the residents' livestock. While Dillon is able to attack
  Grocks by rolling into them, the Grocks can sometimes outnumber Dillon. Thus,
  the villages have established defense towers that can be outfitted with weapons
  that will attack Grocks whenever they are in range. To get guns, Dillon must buy
  them, and sometimes he may have to build the gun tower first. In order to
  improve the villages' defenses, Dillon must collect materials by exploring mines
  and defeating Grocks; the materials can then be used to build stronger doors for
  the village. The stronger a door is, the harder it is for a Grock to get in.

  Goop monsters. Some puzzles require the player to rotate their Nintendo 3DS a
  full 360 degrees, turning the world upside-down, to navigate through tricky
  tunnels and crazy contraptions. Each state of water provides the player with
  different play abilities, all themed to match the properties of that state. This
  is helpful as the ‘chapters’ of the game contain hidden secrets that encourage
  exploration. Discovering all the well-hidden puzzle pieces unlocks bonus
  “playrooms” that provide additional gameplay, and a scoring system (weighing
  speed vs. accomplishment) provides great re-playability. Due to the rotation of
  the hardware during gameplay, this game is not in 3D.

  Go! Go! Kokopolo: Harmonious Forest Revenge is an arcade-style, puzzle-action
  game, in which the player takes on the role of Kokopolo, a hyperactive
  wildcat, in an attempt to get revenge on the cute-looking enemies who
  accidentally wronged him. The game unfolds through 80 stages of fast-paced
  arcade-style gameplay, in which the player needs to clear each stage by
  luring all enemies to their doom into the belly of the carnivorous Snap Snap
  plant located somewhere on the stage. The stages themselves are a unique mix
  of side-scrolling platform elements, and top down puzzle elements. Each world
  is littered with various dangerous hazards, which increase as the game's
  difficulty increases.
  .
  By scratching the enemies with Kokopolo's set of sharp claws, they become
  infuriated and chase him anywhere he goes. With careful timing and fast
  reflexes it is possible to create huge conga lines and chains of enemies for
  multiple scores, but if the enemies catch up with Kokopolo all the hard work
  will be for nothing. Once the enemies have been devoured, the focus shifts to
  the lower screen, where the player can use the stylus or their thumbs in
  order to stop a set of spinning roulette wheels, which symbolize the enemies
  being digested inside the plant's stomach. This allows the player to gain
  bonus points, in the form of fruits, or hazards in the form of bombs.
  .
  The game includes ten boss stages, which are set over both screens, in which
  the player has to figure out the boss' weaknesses, which usually involves
  getting the boss to hurt itself in some way or another.

  your victories by tapping a Kirby series amiibo figure to build a statue in the

  Alt description:

  Kirby’s Blowout Blast is based on Kirby 3D Rumble, which is a mini-game in
  Kirby: Planet Robobot. The game follows the same mechanics as the original Kirby
  game, Kirby's Dream Land, meaning there is no copy ability, like in future
  iterations of the series. The main difference in Kirby’s Blowout Blast is the
  introduction of the 3D environment, which changes the gameplay around. For
  instance, Kirby can now spit enemies he has swallowed in several different
  directions, with the introduction of a small arrow to indicate the direction
  Kirby will spit the enemy out.
  .
  Even though the game is fully playable in 2D, the use of the 3D gimmick gives
  the world a much greater sense of depth, and can sometimes help with the
  gameplay, just like it happened in Planet Robobot.
  .
  Each completed stage awards the player with bonus points, depending on how fast
  the stage was finished, how many enemies were killed, if all coins were
  collected and if damage was avoided. A gold ranking (or higher) will unlock the
  EX versions of the corresponding world, and since there are initially five
  worlds to beat, obtaining that rank in each single world will double the game’s
  length, making 10 worlds available.
  .
  Kirby themed Amiibo work with the game, unlocking several cosmetic extras. Other
  extras are also unlocked by having Kirby Planet Robobot.

developer: G.rev Ltd.
publisher: G.rev Ltd.
genre: Action;Adventure;Shooter
description:
  Kokuga is a slow-moving, free-scrolling top-down shooter where players are
  placed in control of a futuristic "compact mobile tank" known as Kokuga. The
  Kokuga is suspended on four "legs" and features a single turret capable of
  rotating 360 degrees using the shoulder buttons.
  .
  Each stage has the player move through destroying other mechanical, tank-like,
  turret-like, and robotic enemies. Most stages end with massive and varied boss
  battles. Stages are separated into segments with large gates at the
  dividers--destroying all enemies before destroying the divider resorts in bonus
  shield repairs. Destroying the gate without defeating all the enemies in that
  section merely results in all enemies therein being annihilated.
  .
  Kokuga differentiates itself from most other shooters in a variety of ways.
  Rather than collecting power-ups, players already have 20 "cards" to utilize. Of
  these 20 attack and support cards, four are randomly displayed on the
  touch-screen at a time and offer a variety of abilities, from an offensive laser
  ring around the player, to homing shots, to shield restoration and damage
  repairs. Players cannot cycle through the cards, and in order to get new ones,
  at least one current card must be used. In this way, the game offers an unusual
  strategy element to the shooter gameplay--careful and planned use of power-up
  cards over simply powering up as much as possible as soon as possible.

  Nintendo Badge Arcade is a collection of virtual crane machines that award
  decorative icons that the player can use to decorate their Nintendo 3DS' home
  menu. Crane machines rotate in and out frequently, so there is only a short
  window of time in which to collect every badge a machine offers. Plays on the
  crane machines cost real money and can be purchased five at a time. However, it
  is also possible to earn free plays by performing well on the daily practice
  machine, which is modeled on one of the active machines at the time and does not
  award badges. The player also has a random chance of being given free plays the
  first time they load the game on any given day. Since the game is free to start,
  it can potentially be played without making a single payment.

developer: Jupiter Corporation
publisher: Nintendo
genre: Puzzle
description:
  This entry in Nintendo's Picross series has players solve the eponymous puzzles,
  also called nonograms, to form an image of an object or creature from the
  Pokémon universe. The usual rules of picross apply, but are also supplemented by
  the special abilities of the Pokémon available within this game. Every time a
  puzzle is completed, its corresponding Pokémon is captured and can be used in
  subsequent puzzles to provide special powers, including automatically fixing the
  first few mistakes the player makes, revealing several squares when the puzzle
  starts, and hinting at which row to work on next.
  .
  Picrites are a form of currency introduced in the game. With them, players can
  unlock new areas, increase the number of support Pokémon they can use per
  puzzle, and bypass the cooldown times assigned to Pokémon abilities. An energy
  meter limits the number of squares a player can fill in before they need to take
  a break, and Picrites can be used to fill the meter, increase the max energy,
  and eventually remove the meter entirely. Although Picrites can be earned for
  free by finishing the daily training mode, earning achivements, and solving the
  main puzzles, additional Picrites can be purchased through the Nintendo eShop.
  There is a purchase limit of 5000 Picrites, at which point no more money can be
  spent on the game, and additional Picrites can then be obtained for free in
  batches of 1000 at a time.
  .
  There are over 600 puzzles in the game. The basic, main set of puzzles is
  grouped into several different areas that can be traveled to.Sometimes, the
  player can earn a mural piece by completing a main puzzle under specific
  circumstances, which will unlock a new mural puzzle. These puzzles don't cost
  any stamina to play, but support Pokémon cannot be used on them, and they do not
  award any Picrites. However, full completion of a mural board will unlock Primal
  Groudon or Primal Kyogre. Lastly, every main puzzle has a Mega Picross variant
  with more difficult clues to work out.

  lends you his Pikachu to get you started on your adventures. Depart from the
  castle town via a hot-air balloon to get to different areas where wild Toy
  Pokémon await!

  Pokémon's HP runs out, as well as to re-inflate hot-air balloons that have

  the beginning of the adventure and when you speak to Mii characters who come to
  the castle town via StreetPass. You can also purchase Poke Diamonds at the shop
