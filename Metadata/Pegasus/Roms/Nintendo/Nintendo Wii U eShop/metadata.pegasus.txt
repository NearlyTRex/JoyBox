description:
  Affordable Space Adventures is a 2D adventure game in which the player takes
  control of a spaceship named Small Craft, provided by the in-game fictional
  company of Uexplore. The game is split into several levels in which players have
  to control the Small Craft from the entrance of the level until the exit. To do
  so, players must use a variety of systems via the touch-screen on the Wii U
  Gamepad, such as switching from a fuel engine to an electrical engine, changing
  the thrust level and changing the landing gears, among others. In each level,
  players will encounter a series of obstacles, some of them environmental, some
  other being enemies that players have to find a way to sneak around from by
  tweaking the ship's systems to go through undetected. Players can always look at
  the Small Craft's output meters on the Wii U Gamepad's screen to see how much
  heat, electricity and sound they are producing, as well as which of the ship's
  systems are causing it, in order to reduce them and go past the enemies. Some
  enemies will also react to the ship's presence and will have to be scared away
  by pointing the ship's flashlight at them.

  Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, titled Zero: Nuregarasu no Miko (零 〜濡鴉ノ巫女〜?,
  lit. Zero: Black-Haired Shrine Maiden) in Japan and Project Zero: Maiden of
  Black Water in PAL regions, is a survival horror video game developed by Koei
  Tecmo and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The fifth main entry in the Fatal
  Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in
  October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas
  filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the
  Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A
  post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive
  series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which
  is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are
  drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual
  to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is
  tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa.
  .
  Planning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of
  Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke
  Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad
  becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei
  Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow
  co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and
  director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar
  Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several
  revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities
  of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki
  Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the
  gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal
  of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.

  the energy to grow larger. This symbiotic relationship is a central part of life
  on Follie's home world, which is constantly lit up with fireworks - both day and
  night. Flowerworks have another special property: the flowers transform the
  terrain around them, making it more hospitable to Follie's kind. The
  terraforming ability of the Flowerworks means that Follie's relatives have
  spread across the galaxy, turning lifeless rocky planets into ones that
  literally explode with colour and life.

  Woah Dave! is a frantic, score-chasing arcade game where players gun for digital
  glory by destroying monsters, stealing their loose change, and triggering more
  than enough explosions to deplete the O-Zone entirely. Have we mentioned it's
  also incredibly difficult?
  .
  Everything on the map--including your ammunition--is trying to kill you. And
  don't even get me started on the game's hard mode. It's borderline impossible,
  because apparently people who play games are masochists.
