  The NES cult classic is back! Save earth from an alien invasion as the ghost of
  a samurai!
  .
  In 1991, a game was released for the NES that, while it was already clear would
  be something special, no one could have imagined would develop into such a cult
  classic in the years to come. Zombie Nation flew under many people’s radar at
  the time, but its crazy story and solid gameplay accumulated a dedicated fanbase
  over the years. As the disembodied samurai head Namakubi, or in the Japanese
  version a Tengu, you set out to rescue the world from the alien overlord Darc
  Seed, who transformed humanity into mindless zombies. On your way you will
  encounter a variety of bizarre stages and enemies, topped off by the game’s
  (in)famous boss battles.
  .
  This new version for Nintendo Switch incorporates new additions, like quality-of
  -life features such as rewind and quicksave, rapid fire and new HUD elements, as
  is common with re-releases of classic games. You are also able to choose between
  the Western version, “Zombie Nation”, and the Japanese version, “Abarenbou
  Tengu” with two new modes per version. Additionally, there are new achievements
  and a gallery to unlock. All of this makes this the ultimate version of a
  beloved classic, now available on a modern console!

  This deluxe collection brings you every stage from both of famously tough
  platform games, remixed & re-balanced plus an all-new, never-before-seen final
  chapter to bring the experience together for the ultimate experience in nerd
  rage.
  .
  FEATURING...ENHANCED VISUALS!
  .
  Experience the 8-bit ugliness in a whole new way with the updated Game
  Engine!And by updated, we mean "Rebuilt the first game from the ground up in the

  IMPROVED LEVEL DESIGN AND DIFFICULTY OPTIONS!
  .
  Both games are infamously hard-as-nails, but Normal and Easy difficulties come
  with infinite lives, so take as many attempts as you need to beat the challenge.
  Level designs have been improved upon to really nail the balance between tough

  select "Old School" or higher from the difficulty menu and you'll be cursing the
  developers' name in no time.

  QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS!

  Faster respawning (When you die, which will be often, you'll just pop right back

  multiple save slots, accessibility options and more mean that anybody can take
  on the challenge.
  .
  SURPRISES!
  .
  Perhaps you've never played either of these games, perhaps you're new to the
  sequel, or maybe you have spent years achieving the world speedrun record for
  both, but whatever your experience with the series, there are plenty of
  surprises in store for you!

  NEW CHAPTER, COMPLETING THE STORY!

  "Wait, the game had a story" You ask? To which we say: ...Kinda! But there's
  more of it now! Beat both games to unlock the epic finale!

description:
  Axiom Verge is a 2D metroidvania platform shooter centered around the
  protagonist Trace, a scientist who, after an experiment gone wrong, finds
  himself on the world of Sudra. By the time Trace arrives on Sudra he finds this
  world and his civilization collapsed due to the release of the "Pathogen". With
  help of the Russalki (giant war machines that guard Sudra), Trace has to fight
  back the invading forces and return back across The Breach to Earth.
  .
  The world of Sudra is an open world in which Trace can travel back and forth,
  but needs access to better gear and weapons to keep progressing. Several areas
  can be travelled to by means of opening up pathways with the items Trace can
  find along the way. This also involves backtracking. Such items include for
  instance the Modified Labcoat, Grapple, Laser Drill, Address Disruptor and
  Remote Drone. Some weapons can be used to open secret paths. None of the
  available energy based weapons consume ammo. Upgrades for health and weapons can
  also be found while exploring every nook and cranny. Backtracking is needed for
  optionally completing the game entirely, but most of the weapons that are needed
  to finish the game can be found in a linear playthrough.
  .
  The amount of alien flora and fauna on Sudra varies from area to area. The
  enemies respawn after leaving the general area. After killing them they leave
  behind some health.

  Collection from Square Enix. Whether you're a veteran fan in need of a nostalgia

  there's something here for everyone!
  .
  Dragon Quest
  .
  The peace of fair Alefgard has been shattered by the appearance of the nefarious
  master of the night known as the Dragonlord, and the Sphere of Light, which for
  so long kept the forces of darkness in check, has been stolen! It is time for
  you, a young warrior through whose veins flows the blood of the legendary hero
  Erdrick, to set out on a quest to vanquish the Dragonlord, and save the land
  from darkness!
  .
  Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line
  .
  A century has passed since the events of the first DRAGON QUEST, during which
  time the descendants of the hero of Alefgard have forged three new nations. But
  the peace they have known is no more. Demon hosts summoned forth from the
  darkness by High Priest Hargon have brought the land to the brink of ruin once
  again.  Now, the young prince of Midenhall must set out to find the other two
  descendants of Erdrick so that together they might defeat the nefarious Hargon
  and restore peace to their world.
  .
  Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation
  .
  On the morning of your sixteenth birthday, you are charged with a seemingly
  impossible task by the King himself: to assume the mantle of your father Ortega,
  the hero of the land of Aliahan, and slay the Archfiend Baramos, master of
  darkness! What trials await you, intrepid hero, as you set out on a quest not
  even your legendary father was strong enough to complete?

  meanest of all enemies (100% evil!). Each enemy type (and enemy subclass) has
  specific attributes and immunities - evil spirits cannot be hit by melee
  attacks, for example, so the player needs to make them hittable by using spells

  ghostly cat.

  ITTA is a bullet-hell adventure set in a world filled with monstrous bosses.

  toggle on invincibility or player damage multipliers at any time.

  endure along the way.

  Shelly “Bombshell” Harrison takes on a quest to slay evil transhumanist
  mastermind Dr. Jadus Heskel in the streets of Neo DC. She leaves a trail of
  carnage throughout huge, multi-path levels filled with gigantic explosions, more
  secret areas than we can count, and inhuman foes behind every corner. There’s no

  cooked it all into a bloody stew.

  You play a bipedal frog employed by the mysterious start-up company "Cat & Frog
  Inc.". Fend off enemies seeking to stop you and overcome the challenging
  landscape as you head toward your destination.
  .
  When you start the game, you'll likely be surprised by your skimpy amount of
  life and your crappy weapon. And when the frog runs out of life, he "enters the
  hospital" and has to restart from the beginning of the stage. But you can keep
  collecting and saving up money to go "shopping" to increase your life and
  carefully select powered-up weapons to take down enemies you couldn't defeat
  before. The further you get, the stronger you can feel yourself becoming - and
  it feels good.
  .
  The characters appearing in between stages are the game's other charm point.
  You'll meet your coworker, who is a cat (for some reason), your president (also
  a cat), and an office lady of indeterminate species. They work like us, slog
  through overtime like us, complain, get chewed out, and even comfort each other,
  just like us.

  You take another drink as the canvas looms in front of you. A light flickers
  dimly in the corner. You’ve created countless pieces of art, but never anything
  like...this. Why haven’t you done this before? It seems so obvious in retrospect.
  Your friends, critics, business partners—soon, they’ll all see. But something’s
  still missing... You look up, startled. That melody... Was that a piano? It sounded
  just like her... But, no—that would be impossible. She’s gone. They’re all gone.
  Have to focus. How long has it taken to get to this point? Too long, but it
  doesn’t matter. There will be no more distractions. It’s almost finished. You
  can feel it. Your creation. Your Magnum Opus. Dare you help paint a true
  Masterpiece of Fear? Layers of Fear is a first-person psychedelic horror game
  with a heavy focus on story and exploration. Delve deep into the mind of an
  insane painter and discover the secret of his madness, as you walk through a
  vast and constantly changing Victorian-era mansion. Uncover the visions, fears
  and horrors that entwine the painter and finish the masterpiece he has strived
  so long to create.

  Machinarium is a point-and-click adventure set in a mechanical world where the
  player controls a small robot that has been kicked out of the city. He has to
  return and confront the Black Cap Brotherhood who terrorizes his kind and took
  away his girlfriend. The game consists of a number of static, non-scrolling
  screens the player gets to explore. This is done by clicking on objects in the
  environment to manipulate them, gathering them in an inventory and solving a
  wide array of puzzles, ranging from simple item combinations to more complex
  pattern analysis. The player's robot can scale his height to solve a number of
  problems, and communication is often presented graphically through speech
  bubbles that describe a scene using animated images, rather than words.
  .
  It is not possible to die, and when stuck, the player can opt to use a single
  hint (one per screen) or consult a walkthrough book. Pages in this book show the
  full solution to the level in the form of concept art panels, but to reach it a
  short side-scrolling shooter mini-game needs to be played. Therefore, the player
  cannot access it right away. In the beginning progress is done screen by screen,
  but after a while the world opens up more with many locations available at the
  same time.

  Patricia Wagon, you'll use your platforming skills, puzzle-solving abilities,
  and special level-altering Siren Helmet to protect the people of Planet Land and
  smash enemies into the screen! In Mighty Switch Force! and its HD remake, Mighty
  Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition, you'll zap foes while “switching” blocks from
  the foreground to the background (and vice versa) as you track down the
  delinquent Hooligan Sisters in each stage. Then, in Mighty Switch Force! 2,
  Officer Wagon trades in her Pellet Gun for a fire hose as she extinguishes a
  dangerous blaze and rescues would-be victims. Finally, in Mighty Switch Force!
  Academy, you'll put the trainees through their paces in expansive HD stages with
  co-op and versus modes for up to four players. The future of lighthearted law
  enforcement is here!

  Outlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our
  wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness
  and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the
  tribulations of the end of times and you’re right in the thick of it.\n
  You are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of
  you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover
  the stories no one else will dare touch.\n
  You're following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible
  murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe.\n
  The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so
  deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that
  going mad may be the only sane thing to do.

  .
  Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival horror video
  game. A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind
  Games.

  Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical
  and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable
  twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to
  that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the
  character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances
  the terrifying atmosphere of the game.
  .
  The story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who
  reaches Richard Felton’s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of
  a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care

  together.
  .

  themselves into scary monsters.

  In Adventure mode, defeat enemies with attacks based on real-world exercises as
  you traverse more than 100 levels in over 20 worlds. As you work through each
  level (and possibly work up a sweat), you’ll earn experience points. Between
  fights, you may encounter some unusual methods of transportation such as
  squat-powered launch pads. Then, pass around the Ring-Con and leg strap
  accessories and select from a few minigames: break boxes with gusts of air,
  craft pottery using squats, and more.

  Sam & Max Save the World is a graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale
  Games. The game was originally released as Sam & Max: Season One before being
  renamed in early 2009. Save the World was developed in episodic fashion,
  comprising six episodes that were released for Microsoft Windows over the course
  of late 2006 and early 2007. The episodes were initially distributed online by
  GameTap and Telltale Games themselves, although the later retail releases of the
  game were published by The Adventure Company and JoWooD Productions in North
  America and Europe respectively. A Wii port of the game was published in late
  2008, and an Xbox Live Arcade version was released in mid-2009. A remaster of
  the game by Skunkape Games was released in December 2020 for Nintendo Switch and
  Microsoft Windows, and in August 2021 for Xbox One.

  Based on Steve Purcell's comic book series Sam & Max, the game follows the title
  characters Sam and Max—self-styled vigilante private investigators, the former
  an anthropomorphic dog and the latter a "hyperkinetic rabbity thing"—through

  The Swords of Ditto: Mormo's Curse is a compact action RPG that creates a unique
  adventure for each new hero of legend in the relentless fight against the evil
  Mormo. Explore a delightful but dangerous overworld, brave menacing dungeons,
  and improve your hero in a charming village, during your quest to overcome the
  evil that plagues the island. Unleash the mystical Sword of Ditto and grab a
  co-op friend for an unforgettable adventure filled with delightful characters,
  extraordinary loot, and heroic battles!\n
  Key Features:
  .
  .
  Unique Adventures Linked Together: Each adventure becomes its own legend, both
  distinct from those that came before it and part of a heroic legacy that bind
  together. The deeds, successes, and failures of each hero's adventure have
  implications for those that follow including the ability to find weapons and
  recover loot from history’s fallen heroes.
  .
  .
  Solo & Cooperative Adventuring: Battle Mormo and her evil armies alone or summon
  a brave friend to take up arms alongside you in local co-op mode. Fear not, even
  less experienced adventurers will find help from their fellow heroes through the
  magic of a good old-fashioned revival hug!
  .
  .
  Weapons, Items, & Stickers: Wield the traditional sword and bow combo alongside
  the decidedly less traditional vinyl record Frisbee, magic golf club, and
  colossal foot from the heavens to put Mormo and her legions back on their heels.
  Collect and equip stickers to boost up your hero and add perks to their gear to
  become powerful enough to banish the wicked sorceress.
  .
  .
  Main Quests and Secret Side Missions: Approach your legend however you see fit
  by battling through dungeons in any order, completing side missions through dark
  caverns and deep wells, or confront Mormo right from the start for the ultimate
  challenge.

  October 15, 1987. A dead body is rotting under the bridge, but the 81 (sorry,

  Will the ghost, Franklin, get to speak to his daughter again?\n

  Will aspiring game developer Delores choose her family over her dreams?\n
  And most importantly: how come no one cares about that dead body?
  .
  By the end of a long, strange night, these questions will be answered -- and
  you'll understand why in a town like Thimbleweed Park, a dead body is the least
  of your problems.

developer: 8-4, Ltd
publisher: 8-4
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Years after a devastating war between humans and monsters, a child has fallen
  through a hole and into the monsters' underground world. Under the care of a
  kindly monster woman named Toriel, they learn the basics of the underground
  world, including that they may be attacked by other monsters who are less
  friendly. After the child leave's Toriel's care, it's up to them how they
  proceed through the underground, including whether they kill the monsters in
  their way or try to find peaceful resolutions to conflict.
  .
  Undertale is an Eastern RPG with some action aspects in its combat system. In
  the overworld, the player explores areas, solves puzzles, and talks to NPCs.
  When a battle is triggered, typically through random encounter, the game
  switches to the combat screen. A heart representing the child's soul appears in
  a small box, in which objects representing the monsters' attacks appear and must
  be dodged in real time. On the child's turn, they can attack monsters more
  directly through the fight command. A meter that determines the strength of the
  player's attack must be hit with good timing in order to deal more damage.
  .
  Alternatively, players may choose to perform friendly actions in battle or show
  mercy to the opponent in order to resolve conflict without bloodshed. It is
  possible to finish every encounter in the game without killing anyone, though
  some monsters are more difficult to do this with than others. The player may
  need to perform certain actions in the overworld before some monsters can be
  befriended.
  .
  Although only one Undertale save file can be kept at a time, the game remembers
  certain player actions across playthroughs, mainly in reference to how violent
  or peaceful they were. Resetting to an earlier save or starting a new game after
  specific actions are taken can affect how some NPCs treat the player and how the
  story is ultimately resolved.
