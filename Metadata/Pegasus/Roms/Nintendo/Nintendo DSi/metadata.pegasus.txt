  peak of the jump, you'll gain a bit of extra height. You can also use the
  Control Pad to change direction as you climb upwards, allowing you to reach
  out-of-reach grapple points. Finally, you can drop from great heights to your
  advantage, as grappling as you fall past a grapple point will slingshot you back
  in the opposite direction. By mastering all of these techniques, you can quickly
  and skillfully navigate to the goal at the top of the level.

  With your trusty rocket pack, help Rusty defeat the Watchers in three intense

  .
  As the ‘80s were drawing to a close, the developers at Capcom began work on a
  top secret project that aimed to set new standards for the platformer genre.
  That game was called “Dark Void”. Alas, Capcom suspended development on Dark
  Void as it began to evaluate the SNES. Before long, the game was shelved and
  drifted, unnoticed, into the annals of gaming history. Dark Void became a
  legendary “lost project” at Capcom. Now, nearly twenty years later, Dark Void is
  back! To commemorate the game’s humble origins, Capcom has commissioned this
  recreation of the original 8-bit classic, now re-titled “Dark Void Zero”, on the
  Nintendo DSi system. You play Rusty, the first human born in the Void, who must
  take on the Watchers in a quest to stop their domination of Earth. With the aid
  of Nikola Tesla, and his state-of-the-art rocket pack, Rusty must take down the
  Watchers and their minions across three intense levels of action and intrigue.

  Take control of multiple dimensions as Alta in Mighty Flip Champs! Navigate your
  way through different worlds and dimensions as you attempt to make your way to
  the exit. Use your Magical Warp Wand to switch to new dimensions, but watch the
  touch screen when you flip to a new dimension - or you might just get crushed!
  .
  Mighty Flip Champs! is a puzzle game for the Nintendo DSi that uses both the top
  screen and the touch screen for play. The player controls Alta on the top
  screen, and the next dimension in the sequence is displayed on the touch screen.
  As Alta, the player is unable to jump - pressing A, B, X or Y instead uses the
  Warp Wand, which flips the dimension from the touch screen up onto the top
  screen. This allows you to progress forward by creating paths where there would
  otherwise be dead ends. However, it can also be dangerous if used recklessly, as
  you can crush Alta in a wall or make her fall straight onto spikes. At certain
  points in the game, the Warp Wand also malfunctions, and automatically flips to
  new dimensions after set periods of time. In these situations, you need to stay
  on your toes and react quickly to the level changes.
  .
  Mighty Flip Champs! DX is slightly altered to accommodate the platforms it is
  played on. As there is only one screen, the current dimension is displayed on
  the left of the screen, while the next dimension is displayed on the right of
  the screen, mirrored horizontally rather than vertically.

  The Nintendo DSi is the third version of the Nintendo DS handheld gaming
  system. It was announced during the Nintendo Conference 2008 on October 2,
  2008, in Tokyo, Japan. While it is a part of the DS series of handhelds, it
  has been stated that the DSi should be considered as a separate console next
  to the Nintendo DS Lite and the Wii within the United States. The DSi is
  somewhat larger in size but is thinner in depth. It is likely that it is this
  decrease in size is likely what forced the removal of the expansion slot, as
  the bottom portion of the DSi is roughly 12mm, meaning that it is no longer
  backward compatible with Game Boy Advance games, nor is it compatible with
  accessories that use the slot. It introduces several other new features over
  the Nintendo DS Lite.

genre: Miscellaneous;Application
description:
  Rytmik Retrobits is an application for creating rhythmical and melodic themes
  and for composing whole songs. Its user interface blends the fast and
  well-arranged interface of classic drum machines with the flexible pattern
  interface of popular trackers, and with a modern sound library. It contains
  more than 180 carefully selected authentic retro sound samples of electronic
  drums, percussion, bass, melodic instruments and effects from 8-bit and 16-bit
  computers and classic consoles.
  .
  With Rytmik Retrobits you can quickly and easily create the basic building
  block – an audio clip. Each clip consists of musical notation for up to four
  instruments that you can transpose, select their location in the stereo field
  and modify. You can even take advantage of polyphony (with extended polyphony
  handling), chorus/widening stereo effect and echo. You may arbitrarily combine
  up to 128 such clips in four tracks and create complex pieces of music.
  Moreover, you have a collection of 10  re-made compositions at your disposal
  from which you may quickly compose your own pieces.
  .
  Rytmik Retrobits is not only for playing with sounds; in the hands of a
  skillful musician it can become a serious musical instrument – a surprisingly
  powerful pocket music station. For the best musical experience we recommend
  connecting headphones or a quality speaker system. You’ll become the king of
  the retro party in no time...

developer: PopCap Games
publisher: PopCap Games
genre: Puzzle
description:
  Zuma's Revenge is the sequel to Zuma Deluxe. As in the previous game, the main
  goal is to clear a series of marble strings by matching three or more balls of
  the same color. The spheres roll on twisting tracks that occupy most of the
  screen, appearing from one side and moving towards the gaping mouth of a golden
  skull. The player controls a frog that is either stationed near the tracks or
  moving sideways at the bottom. The amphibian holds one of the colored balls in
  its open mouth, and a reserve one inside its body.
  .
  The main Adventure Mode is divided in sequential zones, each with several
  levels. The main objective of each level is to aim and shoot at the moving lines
  to make three-of-a-kind color matches and fill a meter at the top to finish. If
  three or more balls enter the exit hole, the player loses one life and the level
  has to be replayed. When all lives are spent, the whole zone has to be restarted
  from the latest automatic checkpoint, usually at mid-point.
  .
  Some of the spheres are marked with icons and have power-ups that can be
  activated with matches. The bomb explodes all the surrounding spheres, the
  reticule improves shot accuracy by giving temporary laser targeting sights to
  the frog, the rewind arrow pushes all the marbles backwards, the hand slowdowns
  movement for some seconds, the lightning bolt vaporizes all the balls of one
  color, the tri-shot fires three cannon balls that destroy anything in their path
  and the laser surgically removes single spheres. Some levels have pairs of lily
  pads, and the frog can jump between them to eliminate all the marbles.
  .
  A boss battle happens at the end of each zone, where the opponent is an idol
  mask that keeps moving sideways at the top. The frog moves at the bottom and has
  to hit the enemy with several spheres to defeat it, while at the same time
  matching the moving line of spheres to clear the field. Each boss has a
  different attack and defense strategy, throwing enchantment shots at the frog
  and putting obstacles and minions to block the area.
  .
  Besides Adventure Mode, there are three additional modes that are gradually
  unlocked as the levels are completed in the main game. In Challenge Mode, the
  objective is to achieve a high score under three minutes. The top meter is
  replaced by a bonus gauge that slowly fills with every match. When it is full,
  it transforms one of the spheres into a multiplier that gives bonus points after
  being matched. The Heroic Frog Mode is a harder version of Adventure Mode, with
  the spheres moving faster and with more color variations from the start. Iron
  Frog Mode is unlocked after finishing Adventure Mode, and is the hardest mode
  where the player has only one life available to complete ten difficult levels in
  sequence.
