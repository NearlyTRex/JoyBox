publisher: Data East Corporation
genre: Action
description:
  Based on BurgerTime, the Arcade classic from 1982, BurgerTime Deluxe once again
  puts you in the role of chef Peter Pepper, a guy who can really build a burger.
  You maneuver the cook up and down ladders and left and right across floors in
  order to walk across various parts of giant hamburgers, such as large lettuce,
  big buns and massive meat patties. After you cross any section of any hamburger,
  it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a
  floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each
  stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the
  bottom of the screen.
  .
  As you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and
  Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can
  destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by
  tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping.
  To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin
  the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers
  that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the
  guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.
  .
  Unlike the original BurgerTime, which had less than 10 different non-scrolling
  screens, BurgerTime Deluxe has seven levels with four stages in each level for a
  grand total of 28 screens, most of which scroll to some degree. A password
  feature enables you to return to the beginning of last level you played. Also,
  this version of the game features a two-player competitive mode (as long as you
  have two copies of the game, an extra Game Boy, and a link cable).

  He has the offense.\n
  She has the defense.\n
  Together they have a chance, in the ... FORTIFIED ZONE
  .
  - He has the guts. She has the guile.\n
  - But in battle, you're on your own.\n
  - Blast through the front lines.\n
  - Blow their artillery away.\n
  - It takes teamwork to win in the Fortified Zone.
  .
  Fortified Zone was ahead of its time in allowing the player to switch between
  characters during game play. Each character has their own strengths and
  weaknesses: Masato (the male mercenary) uses all the special weapons, but cannot
  jump. Mizuki (the female mercenary) can jump, but cannot use the special
  weapons. A top-down shoot-'em-up, the game had four multi-room levels, titled
  'Field', 'Jungle', 'Caves' and 'Complex'. At the end of each level the player
  faces a 'boss' character: a cannon installation, a supertank, a dragon, a
  bulldozer and a large assault vehicle as the final boss. Items that can be
  picked up in gameplay include medical packs, flamethrowers, hand grenades,
  rocket launchers, 3-way machine guns and chain guns.

  training will he be strong enough to take on the dark forces behind Angel Land's
  troubles. Pit will encounter old friends and new enemies - from helpful
  Centurions to the dreaded Eggplant Wizard - as he journeys from the depths of
  the underworld to the towers of the sky palace. Find hammers to shatter special
  walls and reveal helpful items. Collect hearts by fighting off Pit's foes. Train
  hard and battle harder. Pit's challenges make the labors of Hercules look like a

genre: Action;Platform
description:
  The gluttonous King Dedede has stolen all of the food from the inhabitants of
  Dream Land for a midnight feast, so Kirby, a resident of Dream Land, goes to
  retrieve the food and stop Dedede. Kirby's Dream Land plays like other
  platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various
  natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading
  toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the
  player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has
  enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not
  recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again
  when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title
  screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are
  played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and
  down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies,
  swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.

  In his greatest Game Boy adventure, Mario faces off against his evil rival
  Wario, who has captured Mario Land and turned it into his private playground.
  .
  To toss Wario off his ill-gotten throne, Mario must search all-new worlds for
  the six golden coins that unlock the gate to Mario's castle. A mob of monsters,
  old and new, seek to stop him. Along the way, through 6 zones, Mario can nab
  Power Mushrooms, Super Stars and Fire Flowers for extra power. And if he eats
  the Magic Carrot, he'll turn into a high-flying hare.
  .
  The battery pack saves your game in progress in this biggest Game Boy Mario
  adventure yet.

  In cahoots with exiled alien zap master Krang, the evil Shredder has once again
  kidnapped the dashing damsel of the news desk, April O'Neil. To rescue this
  ravishing reporter, you must return to the sewers and dredge forth those
  reptiles with a penchant for pizza and all the nifty knifework of a chop suey
  chef. You'll control every move of Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and
  Raphael as they arm themselves with head-rattling Nunchakus, back-stabbing Sai
  Swords, and liver-lashing Katana Blades. Of course, this once in a light year
  adventure will really start rumbling the nanosecond you bust into 5
  never-before-seen levels of Manhattan mayhem, including the Traffic Jam, Waste
  Dump Ravine and Technodrome Tower. Here you'll perfect the ancient art of icing,
  dicing and shuriken-slicing. And you'll get the chance to wipe the smirks off
  the faces of all-new creepshow freaks like Roadkill Rodney, Shell Shocker and
  that nasty villain Filet O'Filth. So get back into your shell and start snapping
  away, before April goes from delivering the news to singing the blues in some
  new cement shoes.

  enough to walk above insecure parts of the floor. Bob and Viv are trapped in
  two sides of a mirror. The room Bob is standing in is a mirrored version of
  Viv's room and vice versa. Actions on one side of the mirror affect the other
  side as well. Switch between both protagonists and always think about both
