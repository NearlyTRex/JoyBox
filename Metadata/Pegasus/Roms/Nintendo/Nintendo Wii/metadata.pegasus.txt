  Like the original BOOM BLOX game Bash Party is based around fast-paced gameplay
  that utilizes players' reflexes, dexterity, and problem-solving skills. During
  the action players use the Wii Remote to direct objects and forces toward
  structures made of blocks in order to knock them over. There is also Jenga like
  gameplay during which players pull blocks, with the goal of toppling as many of
  them as possible, but without bringing down the whole structure. In doing this
  players have to deal with the different types of blocks in play. Some of these
  include: gem blocks, blocks with point values attached, explosive blocks that
  detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks,
  and steel blocks. In addition, as the game progresses strategies may change,
  meaning that players must be flexible in order to succeed.

  Bully is a subtle sandbox game set in a school environment. The player takes

  concerns the events that follow Jimmy being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, a
  fictional New England boarding school. The player is free to explore the school
  campus in the beginning and, later on in the game, the town, or to complete the
  main missions. The game makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn
  money, others to improve Jimmy's abilities or get new items.
  .
  School classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five
  levels of increasing difficulty. Each completed class brings a benefit to
  gameplay. English, as an example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy does
  well in this minigame, he learns various language-skills, such as the ability to
  apologize to police for small crimes. Chemistry also an example, is a button
  pushing minigame, and if Jimmy does well, he gains the ability to create
  firecrackers, stink bombs, and other items at his chemistry set in his room at
  the dorm.

  A farming simulation and adventure game. Choose to play as a girl or a boy and
  start life in a farming village with the goal of becoming an expert farm
  manager. Taking over your own farm, you raise plants and animals, catch lots of
  fish, build up your farm, and see your character grow into adulthood. The game
  features cows, horses and sheep, among other animals, but this time around, if
  you don't have a gate around their grazing area, they may get out from your farm
  area and, when night comes, get attacked by wild dogs. You also have added
  freedom with your planting, as you can now raise plants outside your own farm
  area. Once again, interacting with town folk and falling in love are major
  points of the game. Your choice of love interests changes depending on your
  choice of boy or girl at the start of the game.

  In the game, the player controls in turn five teenagers exploring a haunted

  unofficial English patch was released on 03.31.2020 by Brand Newman.

  A group of college students have decided to take a trip to a place called the
  Tsukuyomi Ravine, where people used to sacrifice to the gods. There are five
  main characters in this game, which the game encourages the player to rename
  with the names of their friends: Black, Blue, Yellow, Pink and Red.
  .
  Black invites the group to the ravine, and his father owns the mansion in which
  they're staying at. Red is the hot-tempered leader of the group. He starts the
  whole mess with the statement "Let's test our courage". Blue is kind and has a
  strong sense of justice. Yellow has a pure heart - she is kind, well raised and
  nice to people. Pink states her opinions clearly and makes sure everyone hears
  them. Also, a mysterious young girl comes along the game and she seems to get
  along with Yellow. An extra character, "You", is playable in the epilogue of the
  story. The player controls each of the characters in turn as they explore the
  mansion.

genre: Horror
description:
  It is said that when a person dies with a deep and burning grudge, a curse is
  born. When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly
  fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace
  thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the
  curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody
  who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while
  searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put
  in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face
  their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together
  will their family truly be free again. JU-ON: The Grudge is billed as the first
  “Haunted House Simulator” where accessibility and instant scares are given
  priority over story and game play depth. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight,
  players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such
  as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much
  like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being
  frightened.

  Shuffle" for a non-stopping gameplay, and "Medleys", in which short pieces of 5
  songs are mixed.

  The second new mode, "Duets" allows players to dance together, and in the
  process forces them to pay more attention to the players around them instead of
  simply following on-screen prompts.

  "Dance Battle Mode" is a team mode that features up to 8-player support.The
  individual scores are the basis of the overall team scores.

  Lastly is "Just Sweat Mode", which is an exercise mode that allows players to

  Kirby's body transforms into yarn, rendering his power to inhale useless.
  Instead, Kirby is granted the ability to transform by the magic of the Metamato,
  which he uses to rescue a boy being attacked by a monster. The boy, named Prince
  Fluff, explains that Yin-Yarn has separated Patch Land into pieces, which was
  tied together by magic yarn. Kirby decides to help Prince Fluff collect all
  seven pieces of the yarn and restore Patch Land.

  Meanwhile, Yin-Yarn captures King Dedede and Meta Knight and places them under
  his control. Kirby is forced to fight Dedede and Meta Knight after they ambush
  him in Patch Land. When Kirby and Prince Fluff finally collect all the Magic
  Yarn, Meta Knight, no longer under the sorceror's influence, informs Kirby that
  Yin-Yarn is turning Dream Land into fabric. Prince Fluff produces the second
  sock, its magic fully restored, and uses it to transport Kirby and himself to
  Dream Land; now completely made of yarn. Kirby confronts and defeats Yin-Yarn,
  breaking the spell and returning Dream Land and himself back to normal. Prince
  Fluff parts with Kirby, stating that he can visit Patch Land anytime via

  into one screen when both players are near each other. The hub has also been

  which had been unlocked, now each hub is a large area in which entrances to
  levels must be discovered.

description:
  Embroiled in seemingly endless conflict, the Empire has been slowly weakened by
  the relentless onslaught of enemy forces. Despite the debilitated state of the
  mainland, however, a virtually impenetrable last line of defense stands proud
  and keeps hope alive for all the land. That beacon of hope is Lazulis Island,
  ruled by the renowned Count Arganan. With the employment of an army of weapons
  that magically –and mysteriously-- concentrates beasts into a single region, his
  island has become a small wonder for its powers.
  .
  Among those coming to the island to seek their fortune is Zael, a young man who
  at an early age was orphaned when his homeland became one of the many victims of
  battle. Though he and his band of fellow mercenaries often face disdain and fear
  as they are perceived to be of a lower class, they manage to catch the eye of
  none other than Count Arganan himself. If they can successfully complete the
  tasks put before them by the Count, they may have a rare chance to gain the most
  honorable status that they have only dreamed of - knighthood.
  .
  It is during one of these missions bestowed upon them that Zael discovers a
  hidden site, one which grants him a wondrous and yet familiar power to gather
  his enemies in one place...

  baggage, and inner demons that come to life though the forming of nightmares.
  It's a pretty simple concept overall, and with each child's five main levels
  you'll get a different piece of the story leading up to the same grand finale.
  Once they arrive in the land of dreams, each character meets up with a Nights
  almost instantaneously, and from there learns to meld with the mysterious
  creature and fly through the world of Nightopia. Along the way you'll learn of
  the quest to find the hidden Ideya (basically essences of the human spirit), and
  eventually attempt to defeat a powerful god-like creature named Wizeman and his

  of this classic and colorful mass action strategy game, now available as part of
  the value-minded, family-friendly Nintendo Selects series. The brave Captain
  Olimar has returned to marshal new types of Pikmin in a wild, open-ended
  adventure. On a mission to pay back his employer’s debt, Olimar and his sidekick
  Louie must command squads of tiny Pikmin to help locate valuable treasures,
  exploring mysterious environments and battling pesky enemies along the way.
  Players of any experience level can use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers
  to command these curious creatures and complete their mission. The game also
  invites friends to deviously pit their Pikmin squads against one another in a
  rough and ruthless two-player mode.

  One of the biggest names in boxing returns after a 15-year hiatus. Grab a Wii
  Remote controller in one hand and a Nunchuk controller in the other and step
  back into the ring with a modern update of the classic Punch-Out!! Little Mac is
  back! Everyone’s favorite underdog from the 1980s joins the best of the original
  Punch-Out!! cast in a modern re-imagination of the series. Players will find
  familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers
  come to life again in cel-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting
  animations and back stories that capture all the fun and flair of the original
  Punch-Out!! games. The motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that
  when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you
  can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick
  movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life
  swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played
  with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.

  In Red Steel 2 Wild West gunplay and Samurai skill with the blade collide head

  nearly all that is left of the once powerful Kusagari-clan. A clan known as "the
  Jackals", lead by one known as "Payne", are responsible and now it is the
  Swordsman's duty and you're to avenge the fallen Kusagari.
  .
  Red Steel 2 is a single player first-person shooter developed exclusively for
  Wii and designed to utilize the Wii Remote's optional MotionPlus technology.
  Players will pick up the Wii Remote and swing it freely as the sword on-screen
  follows their precise movement - and even measures the strength of their swing.
  With this added ability of the Wii MotionPlus to sense the strength of a swing,
  you will literally be able to make an impact on your adversaries through power
  and precision and even engage multiple pistol-packing enemies at once,
  deflecting bullets with precise sword strokes. Along with less stylish actions,
  players rack up points through executing combos, finishing moves and other
  actions as members of the rival Jackal clan are eliminated. Additional abilities
  and weapons are earned or are available for purchase as victories pile up.
