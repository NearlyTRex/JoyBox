  This is not your ordinary RPG!
  .
  The graphics are eye-popping, breath-taking, stunning and unbelievable, not to
  mention incredible. This is no hack-and-slash, rip-your-guts-out fighter! This
  is the future of RPGs, right here in your hands! With music this good, you won't
  turn the sound off--you'll turn it up!
  .
  No more small elves leading your team! This game contains real, believable
  figures. You won't be embarrassed to use your own name; you'll be proud. It's
  just you against six other characters in search of the 7 Sacred Runes. Whoever
  finds them... Rules the World. It's that simple, that easy. The only problem is
  you have some enemies, and I don't mean a few. I mean an army of things you've
  never seen before ready to raise the hair on the back of your neck and take you
  out with one swing. This is one powerful RPG. Can you handle it?!

description:
  Donkey Kong is back in Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country, with a new sidekick,
  Diddy Kong, in a crazy island adventure. Challenged by the crazed tribe of
  reptilian Kremlings, they endeavor to get back their stolen banana horde! Armed
  with lightning-quick moves, chest-pounding muscle and awesome aerial acrobatics,
  our duo is ready to face their cunning adversaries. With the help of Donkey
  Kong's quirky family and his wild animal mounts, they squabble and scamper their
  way through the unending monkey mayhem.
  .
  The Donkey Kong Country Competition Cartridge is a cut-down competition variant
  of Donkey Kong Country manufactured for use in the Nintendo PowerFest '94 game
  competition and later featured in the Blockbuster World Video Game Championships
  II event. Only 2,500 copies of the Competition Cartridge were released.  The
  actual game consists of a few select levels from Donkey Kong Country with the
  addition of a point counter and a few minor tweaks to encourage scoring, the
  goal being to score as many points as possible. The tree house and banana cave
  at the start of Jungle Hijinxs have been disabled and all of the Animal Tokens
  in the early levels have been replaced with banana bunches, making it impossible
  to reach the bonus round without the usage of a cheating device. The player is
  also given 50 starting extra lives instead of the 5 as in the original game. The
  game has a time limit of five minutes, which is displayed at the center of the
  screen. After the allotted time, the game freezes.

  Okay kid, wipe that drool off your chin and listen up if you really want to
  learn something about this game. Sure, it's got newfangled computer graphics and
  what Diddy calls stereo sound that "rocks heavily and with little resistance!"
  BUT, the game play? Well, they FINALLY added some proper challenge to the game -
  a snap for me of course. AND THE STORY? You sure ask a lot of questions, kid!
  Kaptain K. Rool and his cruelest cut-throat Kremlings have kidnapped that
  flea-bitten ape Donkey Kong. I figured I'd rescue him when the little pip-squeak
  DIDDY pops up along with his girlfriend, and they head off fixin' to prove
  themselves heroes or something. Come to think of it, I haven't laid eyes on
  those two for quite a while. I just may have to help them out after all!

developer: Ape Inc.
publisher: Nintendo
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  In the year 199X, in the village of Onett, on the continent of Eagleland...
  .
  Young Ness was asleep one night when a loud crashing noise awoke him suddenly.
  As he rushes out of bed and up to a nearby hill, he encounters a strange meteor,
  carrying a single passenger: a mysterious insect-like being named Buzz Buzz.
  Buzz Buzz tells him that in the future, an evil alien being known as Giygas has
  conquered the world, and the only one who can stop him are four young kids:
  three boys and a girl. Ness, of course, is one of the chosen ones, and he must
  find the other three children: Paula, a young girl with remarkable psychic
  powers, Jeff, a mechanical genius, and Poo, the young Prince of Dahlaam.
  Together, these four friends have the power to defeat Giygas and save the world
  from his chaotic reign!
  .
  EarthBound is a sequel to Mother. It is a top-down role-playing game in which
  the heroes travel around Eagleland and various other, exotic countries, trying
  to end Giygas' evil influence.
  .
  On the way, Ness and his friends will encounter a lot of enemies and battle them
  in turn-based combat. Unlike in the previous game, enemies are visibly walking
  on the screen. Each turn, each of the characters in the party can attack with
  their weapons, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic
  powers that can hurt enemies, heal comrades and more; some also have some other,
  unique special powers), use an item or try and escape.
  .
  The game features "rolling HP meters" - when a character is dealt damage, it's
  not all taken away from his HP right away, but instead his HP decreases slowly;
  if the combat is ended quickly, even a massively damaging attack can leave a
  character with only minor injuries. By winning battles, characters receive
  experience and thus become stronger. If the player-controlled characters are
  strong enough, weak enemies will escape from them instead of trying to attack;
  when chased down, they will be defeated instantly.
  .
  Saving the game is done by finding a telephone and calling Ness' father. When
  the heroes defeat enemies, Ness' bank account receives money, which can be then
  retrieved from ATM machines throughout the game and spent in shops to buy better
  equipment or useful items.
