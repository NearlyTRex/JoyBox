  The gaming sensation designed to stimulate your brain.
  .
  • Stylus controls and quick activities—so easy to learn\n
  • Fun math and logic puzzles keep your mind in shape\n
  • Keep track of your "Brain Age" and improve over time
  .
  Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day for Nintendo DS is a fun, rewarding
  form of entertainment everyone can enjoy, as it helps players flex their mental
  muscles. Brain Age is inspired by the research of Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, a
  prominent Japanese neuroscientist. His studies evaluated the impact of
  performing certain reading and mathematic exercises to help stimulate the brain.
  .
  Brain Age presents quick mental activities that help keep your DS brain in
  shape. Activities include quickly solving simple math problems, counting people
  going in and out of a house simultaneously, drawing pictures on the Touch
  Screen, reading classic literature out loud, and more. You can also play sudoku,
  the number puzzle game which has become an extremely popular feature in U.S.
  newspapers.
  .
  We all know as we grow older our bodies change and it becomes important to
  regularly exercise to maintain health and fitness. Our brain is no different.
  "Use it or lose it," as the adage goes. New research indicates mental acuity may
  be strengthened, like muscles, with brain exercises.
  .
  That's where Brain Age comes in.
  .
  Dr. Elizabeth Zelinski, dean and executive director of University of Southern
  California’s Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, says games like Brain Age can
  help keep older generations of Americans’ minds active. “Americans can do a
  great deal to maintain and even improve their mental abilities,” Zelinski
  explains. “Aging is about taking on new challenges for our minds. Nintendo’s
  Brain Age is a great way to do that.”
  .
  How does Brain Age work?
  .
  The Brain Age exercises are designed to stimulate your brain. Solving simple
  math and logic problems quickly, and reading aloud, have been proven to be
  effective methods of achieving this goal.
  .
  The distinctive Nintendo DS Touch Screen lets users write their answers with a
  Stylus pen, just as though they were writing on paper or using a Personal
  Digital Assistant or "PDA". Furthermore, the Nintendo DS's voice input
  identifies particular words you'll speak during the Stroop Test.
  .
  Brain Age tracks your progression through each exercise with easy-to-read line
  charts. Consistently using Brain Age each day will open new exercises to test
  your ability.
  .
  Brain Age includes a fun calculation competition for friends and family. Only
  one Brain Age Game Card is needed. With the DS's user-friendly interface, it's a
  snap to download this minigame to as many as 15 DS systems!
  .
  Baby Boomers and test-prepping school kids alike want to challenge themselves
  and find ways to stay sharp. Brain Age acts like a treadmill for the mind. With
  the simplicity of the Nintendo DS, and Brain Age's challenging and rewarding
  exercises, everyone can stimulate their DS brain, improving speed and accuracy
  of their game play.

  Drawn to Life is an action-adventure platform video game for the Nintendo DS
  developed by 5th Cell and published by THQ in 2007. It was later published by
  Agatsuma Entertainment in Japan in 2008 under the name Drawn to Life: God's
  Marionette (????????? ????????? Doron to Raifu: Kami-sama no Marionetto?). In
  the game, the player creates their own playable characters, level objects, and
  accessories by drawing them using the DS's stylus and Touch Screen. The game was
  ported to iOS by WayForward Technologies and released by 505 Games on May 22,
  2014.
  .
  Drawn to Life requires the player to create a hero in order to free a cursed
  village from an encroaching darkness. It features numerous platforming levels, a
  top down central village, and other elements such as vehicles, weapons, and
  platforms, which are drawn or colored by the player using the stylus.
  .
  Two sequels have come out, both under the title Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter,
  for release on the Wii and DS. A spin-off title, Drawn to Life: SpongeBob
  SquarePants Edition (based on the SpongeBob SquarePants episode
  "Frankendoodle"), was developed by Altron for the DS.

  Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter is the sequel of the video game Drawn to Life.
  .
  The game begins with a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the
  player “What do you remember about that day?” The player is given several
  dialogue choices that build a cohesive description of "that day", though at this
  time, the player is not aware of the event's importance (or even occurrence).
  Before the game properly begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting
  this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core "draw" functionality.
  .
  Following this is an animation sequence wherein one of the characters from the
  previous game, Heather, recovers from a nightmare. She is shown to possess a
  red-colored jewel pendant. In the same sequence, Heather is abducted by a
  darkness which emanated from a scepter she discovered in a beached treasure
  chest in the middle of the night. The next morning, when the other characters
  realize she's missing, a search for her is dramatically cut short by Wilfre, who
  causes the majority of the Raposa villagers to vanish, reveals himself as
  Heather's captor, and ultimately drains the Village of color. The remaining
  characters flee to the back of a massive turtle delivered, upon request, by the
  Creator.
  .
  Their numbers sorely reduced and their home ruined, the game follows the
  Raposa's struggle to reunite with their fellows and, with the aid of the
  Creator's Hero of Creation, defeat Wilfre before he can realize his as-yet
  unknown goals. The remaining members of the Village travel to Watersong,
  Lavasteam, the Galactic Jungle, and Wilfre's Wasteland, a combination of all
  three villages.

  Like its parent, the Xbox Live Arcade game Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved,
  Galaxies has the player control a ship that can shoot and travel in 8 directions
  and is controlled primarily with analog sticks and a single button to activate
  bombs. The playing space is a flat 2D plane, but unlike Evolved there are
  multiple planes (or levels) that vary in size and shape. The planes are
  typically a near-black background lit up with a grid, but enemies are brightly
  colored shapes that fill the screen with particles and colors when attacking the
  player.
  .
  Galaxies differs from Retro Evolved in that the single-player component has many
  different levels rather than the single provided in Evolved, each with its own
  set of score goals. Galaxies also adds a new mechanic of the drone, which acts
  as a helper ship that can perform one user-selected duty at a time such as
  rotating shield, secondary shooter, backwards shooter, etc.
  .
  The Wii version includes Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved and can interface with the

description:
  Nintendo DS Browser makes use of the Nintendo DS's touchscreen for input, with
  an on-screen keyboard as well as handwriting recognition and a stock of pre-set
  text (for example, the .com and .org top-level domains).
  .
  The browser can render pages in two modes, Small Screen Rendering (SSR) or
  Overview. In Small Screen Rendering mode, the contents of the page are displayed
  in a single column fitting the width of the screen - for example, a page
  featuring two columns of text side-by-side would be displayed as a single
  column, one after the other. In Overview mode, a scaled-down version of the page
  is displayed on the touchscreen with a small selection box which can be moved
  around using the stylus. The contents of the selection box are displayed on the
  top screen at their full size. This selection can be brought into the
  touchscreen to perform such actions as click on links or entering text in boxes.
  .
  The browser connects to the network through IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi access points or
  hotspots using the built-in wireless capability of the Nintendo DS. While WEP
  encryption is supported, WPA encryption is not.
  .
  Nintendo has partnered with Internet security company Astaro to integrate web
  filtering technology into the Nintendo DS Browser. Called Astaro Parental
  Control, the technology acts as a proxy filter, providing the option of blocking
  inappropriate content.[6] This is provided free of charge and can be activated
  through a simple menu option.
  .
  The Nintendo DS browser supports JavaScript and SSL in web pages,[7] but does
  not support plugins like Adobe Flash, or bold text.[8] Due to limited system
  resources, most other dynamic media, such as videos or sound, will not work in
  the browser.

genre: Life Simulation
description:
  Nintendogs (Japanese: ニンテンドッグス Hepburn: Nintendoggusu?) is a realtime pet
  simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS
  handheld video game console. It was first released in Japan, and was later
  released in North America, Australia, Europe, and other regions. It was
  originally released in three different versions: Dachshund & Friends, Lab &
  Friends (Shiba & Friends in Japan), and Chihuahua & Friends. It has been
  re-released twice since then, first as a bundled release with a special edition
  Nintendo DS with a new version called Nintendogs: Best Friends, and then later
  as Nintendogs: Dalmatian & Friends.
  .
  Nintendogs uses the DS's touchscreen and built-in microphone. The touch screen
  allows the player to pet a dog, as well as to use various items that can be
  found or purchased. These range from balls and frisbees, to toys, to grooming
  supplies to keep the dogs happy. The microphone is used to call to the player's
  dog by speaking the name given to the dog in the beginning of the game as well
  as to teach the dog tricks such as "sit" or "roll over". Players can bring their
  dogs on walks and to the park if they so choose. They may interact with other
  players in multi-player by using the DS's wireless linkup. It also uses the DS's
  internal clock and calendar to allow the dog to grow hungrier or dirtier based
  on the elapsed time.
  .
  Nintendogs received critical acclaim. It has an aggregate score of 85% at Game
  Rankings,[3] and has won many awards, including the 2006 Innovation Award from
  PC World and Best Handheld Game from the Associated Press. As of March 31, 2015,
  all versions of Nintendogs combined have sold 23.96 million copies worldwide,
  making it second on the Nintendo DS best-sellers list, behind only New Super
  Mario Bros.[4] Because of Nintendogs' success, Nintendo has made several related
  products, including Nintendogs toys[5] and a series of Nintendogs trading
  cards.[6] At E3 2010, it was announced a sequel, titled Nintendogs + Cats, would
  be released for the Nintendo 3DS.

description:
  Space Invaders Revolution is a new take on the series, which marks a true
  progression over any version before it: New types of invaders, new rules and new
  ways to destroy them. Contains a faithful reproduction of the original arcade
  machine in Classic Mode. New Era mode: the simple rules of Space Invaders are
  expanded and twisted into a revolutionary step for the classic franchise. New
  Era mode takes the form of a world tour, with the player confronting the Space
  Invaders at 20 recognisable geographical locations. In total there are 60 levels
  to defend and 13 different types of invader to battle. Power-ups include
  protective shields, additional support craft, rapid-fire shots and
  column-clearing laser beams - essential aides as the action becomes
  progressively more intense. Power-ups can be used in combination: using support
  craft with laser results in three laser beams, decimating multiple waves of
  invaders with every press of the fire button.
