genre: Racing;Platform
description:
  The main character in the game is a female driver, Clarice, of a Honda City (the
  North American version features a male driver) on a tour of all the sights and
  roads across the world. To prove that she has visited a particular location, she
  must drive around the location painting every section of the road white.
  However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the
  driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil.
  To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads
  change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road
  has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The
  police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main
  character's car, the car "explodes" by turning into a group of hearts and the
  player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which
  can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player
  to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit,
  causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the
  screen (but does not cause the car to "explode") with playing of a comical
  music, "Der Flohwalzer", known as "Neko Funjatta" (I Stepped on the Cat) in
  Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car "explode" on contact.
  Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches
  one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will
  activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides
  significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the
  difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you
  travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One
  particular thing about this game is the "catchy" tune that plays in the
  background as you enter a new city. Although it uses "ethnic" variations
  according to the destination, it's an adaptation of a famous classic piece,
  "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso", from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.

game: Cobra Triangle (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Nintendo/Nintendo NES/Cobra Triangle (USA)/Cobra Triangle (USA).json
developer: Rare
publisher: Nintendo
genre: Racing
description:
  There are 25 stages in the game, including bonus stages. Each series of five
  generally contains one of each type of mission. The fifth are generally the boss
  stages. The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a
  giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The
  game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are
  collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired
  powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns
  to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are "Turbo" (increase the speed of the
  boat), "Fire" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), "Speed"
  (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), "Missile" (improves missiles) and
  "Force" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat
  used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple
  spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be
  upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the
  Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the
  cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The
  boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or
  enemy fire.

  When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an

  magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil
  magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to
  use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other
  magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder.
  Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever
  created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them
  far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a
  great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great
  War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of
  their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank,
  even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in
  this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician,
  making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the
  weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will
  threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the
  world from his scourge of evil!

  You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal

  need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but
  you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge
  points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when
  approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the
  landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.
  .
  You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When
  in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often
  destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the

  Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements. On each

  To help out, you have a magic wand which can be used to create and destroy
  blocks (though some blocks can't be destroyed). In order to reach the key you
  will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way
  around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will
  cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by
  destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses
  and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks.
  Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal
  with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit
  in which it must be completed.

  Strap on your seat belt! Here's rollicking fun with Baloo Bear and his cargo
  plane, the Mini-Sea Duck. He's out delivering goods to all the people in the
  cape. But Don Karnage and his goofy band of pirates are hot on Baloo's tail
  wind, trying to swipe the cargo! It's high-flying adventure as Baloo dodges and
  shoots through the clouds and over skyscrapers. It's low-flying fun as he zips
  through a haunted house where hats and gloves join the chase. Alligators and
  natives rumble in the jungle. Cave dogs bash Baloo with bones. Submarines
  transform into helicopters. Baseballs as big as boulders give Baloo a rocky
  ride! Baloo's got 8 trips to make so he's got to be a frisky flyer. Grab your

  Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained
  a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of
  over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil
  to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of
  torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces
  and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails.
  .
  But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels,
  including Vinnie's Valet "Stalking" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new
  never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced
  by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as
  Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the
  all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known
  defeat.
  .
  Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching
  them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and
  turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the
  forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for

genre: Puzzle
description:
  A random sequence of tetrominoes (sometimes called "tetrads" in older
  versions)â€”shapes composed of four square blocks eachâ€”fall down the playing field
  (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the "well" or "matrix"). The objective of
  the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and
  rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of
  blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block
  above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the
  game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the
  tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes
  reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter.
  In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the
  way to level 15.
  .
  All of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are
  able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines
  simultaneously, and this is referred to as a "tetris". (This may vary depending
  on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation.
  For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations,
  called "Easy Spin" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to
  'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)

description:
  1999. What appeared to be a harmless meteorite crashing in the Nevada desert has
  turned out to be Darc Seed, an evil alien creature with horrible powers. By
  shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into
  zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work.
  These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were
  more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of
  the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set
  off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and
  knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil
  clutches of Darc Seed.
