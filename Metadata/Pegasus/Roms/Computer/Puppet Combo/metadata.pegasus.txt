  be a prank. Limited portions of the tape have been released to the public
  in hopes of identifying the persons involved."

  who carries around a camera and wanders around an abandoned, ruined building

  there, as they even walk inside at one point. At the end of the game, the
  character films a house burning downhill, sirens can be heard in the
  background. The tape then suddenly cuts off.
