description:
  The 11th Hour is the sequel to the widely successful game, The 7th Guest. It
  utilizes a much improved video compression engine by Graeme Devine and is also
  the game which brought forth Trilobyte's eventual demise.
  .
  This time you play the role of Carl Denning, boyfriend to the reporter Robin
  Morales. Robin has mysteriously vanished while trying to delve into the secrets
  of the rotting mansion of the once evil mastermind, Henry Stauf.
  .
  The game features new puzzles, redone graphics and indeed an improved engine -
  much smoother, with 16 bit graphics and an entirely new soundtrack. The basic
  gameplay is still similar to its predecessor: the player walks through the
  mansion, watches FMV sequences and solves logic riddles. The so-called GameBook,
  a laptop, can be consulted to receive puzzle hints.

  eerie lights and the terrible sing-song rhymes of the children...\n
  And suddenly, you are in the house. You move from room to haunted room, step by
  terrifying step, as scenes from that night of horror come to life. Because
  Stauf's game isn't over. There were six guests the world knew about - and there

  nightmare and learn the secret of The 7th Guest.

  Once, the land of Akalabeth was peaceful and quiet. But then came Mondain, an
  evil and ambitious man who created dungeons and populated them with foul
  creatures. The noble warrior British was able to drive Mondain from Akalabeth,
  but the monsters he brought with him remain.
  .
  As either a fighter or a mage, it is your job to explore Akalabeth, descend into
  the dungeons and vanquish the beasts dwelling within. On an overhead map of the
  land, one can find the dungeons, towns where one may buy supplies, weapons and
  armor, and a castle, where one will be given quests by Lord British. To fulfill
  such a quest, a certain type of creature must be destroyed in a dungeon.
  .
  Inside the dungeons, the view switches to a first-person perspective. Fight,
  explore and find treasure on your way to complete a quest. Each successive quest
  will require you to destroy a stronger monster, which will reside on a deeper
  dungeon level than the one before it.

  Akalabeth is the precursor to the Ultima series.

description:
  In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the player takes on the role of Daniel, an
  amnesiac man trapped in the mansion of a Prussian Baron named Alexander. The
  only clues to Daniel's true identity are mementos and notes left behind by
  Daniel himself, who reminds himself to find and kill Alexander. Gameplay has the
  player searching for Daniel's diaries and other notes and journals of the poor
  souls who have crossed Baron Alexander. The player must solve the mystery of the
  mansion while running from a Shadow that is constantly chasing the player
  throughout the game.
  .
  The game takes place from a first person perspective, however there are no
  weapons. Daniel cannot fight monsters and the only choice is to run or hide.
  Along with self-preservation, the players must keep the hero sane. In order to
  stay sane, he must keep moving and pushing the plot forward, as well as making
  sure there is always light. It is often necessary to scour every corner for oil
  and tinderboxes. Oil will allow Daniel to use a lamp to provide him with light
  and tinderboxes can be used to light candles and torches strewn throughout the
  mansion. If Daniel remains in the dark for too long, he will gradually lose his
  sanity. As Daniel loses sanity, the world will distort and become hard to
  navigate and the monsters will be able to sense the player. The player must
  evade the monsters entirely, but this will affect Daniel's sanity as to hide
  from the monsters, the player must also hide in the dark. The player must also
  never look at the monsters because if Daniel stares at them too long, his sanity
  will be fully compromised.
  .
  The player must solve various puzzles and the game is very much a fully
  interactive adventure game. Interaction with the environment is performed by
  using a physics based method where the mouse is emulated as a hand, meaning the
  player will need to rotate it to turn wheels or use it to grab drawers and pull
  them open by moving the mouse. It is also possible to pick up objects and throw
  them to distract the shadow or solve certain physical puzzles.

  select from several choices of what to say. It is a more natural system, like in
  Ultima Underworld. The combat has not changed significantly, except that there
  are new weapons, and many more spells, than in previous games, and these have
  altered graphics. The sprite animation has been expanded on, and additional
  frames added to the character animations. The isometric tile-by-tile scrolling

description:
  In the year 1960 a plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with a man
  named Jack as the only survivor. He has the apparent luck of resurfacing in
  front of what looks like a door to an underwater complex. Without hesitating,
  Jack enters the door and is greeted by slogans that praise the city of Rapture,
  a paradise of free will built in the 1940's by a business magnate named Andrew
  Ryan. However, even before he assimilates all this new information, the descent
  to this supposed paradise ends and he can only see ruins and chaos. Learning
  about the destiny of Rapture will be now Jack's main motivation while he tries
  to survive the horrors that the free will can create.
  .
  BioShock is a first-person shooter with gameplay elements and storytelling
  technique reminiscent of System Shock games. Rapture, the once proud social
  experiment inspired by the real-world objectivist philosophy of Ayn Rand, has
  been nearly destroyed, its inhabitants either dead or fallen victims to bizarre
  scientific experiments. The retro-futuristic setting incorporates elements of
  sci-fi with art deco and steampunk influences, featuring interior design and
  propaganda posters reminiscent of 1950's.
  .
  The game's plot is largely revealed through recorded messages left by Rapture's
  inhabitants before they were killed or mutated. Much of the plot development is
  therefore dedicated to reconstructing the events of the past, similarly to
  System Shock games. Limited usage of stealth, the possibility to hack security
  cameras and other devices, and character customization are the gameplay elements
  that further tie BioShock to its spiritual predecessors.
  .
  In its core, however, the game is more action-oriented, restricting the
  role-playing mechanics of System Shock 2 to abilities and upgrades that can be
  acquired and equipped by the main character. Most of the enemies in the game are
  Splicers, the deformed and insane citizens of Rapture. The protagonist has an
  arsenal of firearms to combat them, but is also able to use plasmids, which act
  similarly to magic and deplete a special energy called EVE. Various types of
  plasmids may directly hurt enemies, sabotage their movements, or enhance the
  player character's defense. Combat tactics often rely on successive usage of
  different types of weapons and plasmids. For example, encasing an enemy in ice
  with a plasmid makes it possible to shatter it to pieces with a single shot;
  protecting himself with an electric shield, the protagonist can electrocute
  enemies and strike them with melee weapons, etc.
  .
  The player can only equip a limited number of active and passive plasmids, and
  also has an inventory limit for every type of item. Restoring and enhancing
  items can be found by exploring the environment or purchased from vending
  machines. These can also be hacked, similarly to turrets, cameras, safes, and
  other types of locks. Hacking is presented as a Pipe Mania-like mini-game.
  .
  Plasmids, on the other hand, are mostly purchased by spending certain amounts of
  a mutagen known as ADAM. This mutagen can be obtained from mysterious creatures
  called "Little Sisters" - little girls that can be seen in most of the game's
  locations, accompanied and protected by very strong, genetically enhanced humans
  grafted to armored diving suits and nicknamed "Big Daddies". In order to capture
  a Little Sister the player normally has to defeat her Big Daddy. Afterwards, the
  player has the choice of killing the girl, harvesting large amounts of ADAM in
  process, or sparing her life. Depending on the player's moral decisions
  concerning the Little Sisters, the game's story will be concluded with different
  endings.
  .

  This game starts within minutes of where Black Mirror II ended. The Black Mirror
  Castle is burning, and Adrian Gordon (aka Darren Michaels), son of Samuel Gordon
  from the first game, is found running through the forest holding a lit torch.
  The police arrest him as their prime suspect, but they get nowhere during their
  interrogations since his own mind is a mass of confusion. While in custody,
  Adrian is plagued by convoluted, gruesome nightmares that interrupt his sleep at
  night and haunt him by day. When someone unknown posts his bail, he is set free.
  He has so many unanswered questions and so many fears. He gradually begins to
  suspect that his past is irrevocably linked with evil.
  .
  Black Mirror III is a third person, single-player, point-and-click adventure
  game much the same as the previous game but with improvements to sound and
  graphics. Its six chapters take place in Willow Creek and the areas near the
  Black Mirror Castle with many new locations to explore and new NPC characters.

  chapters control of two characters will be possible and necessary.

developer: Headfirst Productions
publisher: 2K Games
genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Stealth
description:
  Detective Jack Walters arrived in Innsmouth to solve a case of a missing person.
  But soon he finds himself confronted with terrible mysteries older than
  humanity, and with ghosts of the mysterious events that led to his incarceration
  in a mental hospital years ago.
  .
  Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a first-person action-adventure
  survival horror game, based on the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and his short story
  "The Shadow Over Innsmouth".
  .
  Initially, CoC: DCotE plays like an adventure game, but soon it gains elements
  of a stealth game and of a first-person shooter. Notably, the game does not
  feature an on-screen HUD (not even a crosshair); Jack's health is hinted at by
  visual cues; as for ammo, you need to remember how much you have left before
  you'll have to reload.
  .
  The health system used in the game is uncommon. There is no "hit points" system;
  rather, Jack receives minor or major wounds in specific parts of the body, and
  if he breaks a leg he's slowed down. To heal himself and prevent death from
  bleeding out, Jack can pick up medikits which contain bandages, splints, sutures
  and antidotes, each of which is used to heal a specific type of wound. Ill
  effects emerging from the wounds can be temporarily suppressed with a fix of
  morphine.
  .
  Jack's sanity also plays an important role. When Jack looks at disturbing things
  or finds himself in alarming conditions, his vision blurs, he begins hearing
  voices and talking to himself. If this gets too bad, Jack may go insane or
  commit suicide. Also, Jack suffers from acrophobia, and looking down in high
  places will cause him vertigo.

  Crypt of the NecroDancer is an independent video game developed by Brace
  Yourself Games. The game takes fundamental elements of a roguelike dungeon
  exploration game, and adds a beat-matching rhythm game set to an original
  soundtrack written by Danny Baranowsky. The player's actions are most effective
  when moving the character set to the beat of the current song and are impaired
  when they miss a beat, so it is necessary to learn the rhythmic patterns that
  the various creatures follow.
  .
  The mixed-genre game includes the ability to import custom music, and the option
  to use a dance pad instead of traditional controllers or the keyboard. The game
  was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in April 2015, being

  light from the lighthouse has suddenly gone out without explanation and he
  should go investigate. Why him? Why now .. in the middle of the night?
  .
  Making his way to the dark Fetch Rock Lighthouse, he soon discovers that the 3
  lighthouse keepers have disappeared without a trace! Sifting through information
  left behind, Parker finds evidence of another presence - something (or someone)
  else is here! Is the lighthouse haunted? What happened to the three men? Why did
  the lights go out? And, what is the real reason he was asked to come here?
  .
  To find those answers, Parker will be mystically transported to different
  periods in the lighthouse's time-line. Exploring in first person "Myst-like"
  style, interact with objects, reading materials and puzzles. Ambient sound
  effects, moody shadows and eerie music add to the immersion factor.

developer: Access Games
publisher: Ignition Entertainment
genre: Action;Horror
description:
  Deadly Premonition is an open world, survival horror video game developed by
  Access Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In 2010, the Xbox 360 version was
  published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in
  Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe, while the PlayStation 3 version was
  simultaneously released only in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment. A director's
  cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by
  Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of
  Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York
  Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is
  similar to a series of murders across the United States.
  .
  Deadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video
  game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after
  its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues.
  .
  The game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy
  horror theme to the survival horror genre. It is also notable for implementing a
  free-roaming storyline within an open game world where all the characters have
  their own schedules.
  .
  It has become known for its "headline making strangeness" and is considered one
  of the most critically polarising games of all-time (holding the Guinness World
  Record for most critically polarizing survival horror game), receiving both
  extremely negative and extremely positive reviews and is seen by some as an
  example of games as art.

  The year is 1988. Adventure game developer Delores Edmund, on hiatus from her
  job at MMucasFlem Games, has returned to Thimbleweed Park for a quick vacation.
  While she's home, she's making some extra money as a photographer for the
  Thimbleweed Nickel News. Hey, game developers need to eat, too!
  .
  Thimbleweed Park hasn't changed at all in the year since Delores has been away...
  or has it?
  .
  ...Since when is the S&D Diner a five-star establishment?\n
  ...When did the PillowBear™ become all the rage?\n
  ...Why is Ransome the Clown suddenly winning humanitarian awards?\n
  ...How come no one seems to remember that dead body that turned up under the
  bridge a year ago?\n
  ...Can Thimbleweed Park get any stranger?!.
  .
  In a town like Thimbleweed Park, a side career in photojournalism is the least
  of your problems...
  .
  Delores: A Thimbleweed Park Mini-Adventure started out as a prototype for Ron
  Gilbert's new point-and-click adventure game engine and grew into a fun little
  game. It is not a sequel to Thimbleweed Park and is probably missing all of the
  small bells and whistles that would make it a commercially viable game.
  .
  This was a challenging game to make because we had to use almost exclusively
  “found art” from Thimbleweed Park to create all new puzzles. Also because we
  couldn't go outside IRL.
  .
  As a thank you to our fans, we are releasing it for free as something you can
  have fun with in these odd times. You don't have to have played Thimbleweed Park
  to enjoy this mini-adventure. (But if you do enjoy it, why not check out
  Thimbleweed Park, hmm?)
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  • Non-stop point-and-click fun!
  .
  • Return to Thimbleweed Park, the setting of the Best Adventure of 2017 award
  from Adventure Gamers and the Thank You for Not Still Living at Home award from
  Ron Gilbert's mom. (Or, visit Thimbleweed Park for the first time! No prior
  knowledge required to play!)
  .
  • Explore Main Street and solve puzzles to take pictures for Thimbleweed Park's
  hard-hitting newspaper. One of these days Natalie will get that Pulitzer, and it
  will be thanks to your help!
  .
  • Tackle increasingly difficult assignments as you get closer to figuring out
  what the heck is going on in Thimbleweed Park this time.

  SCUMM engine and classic games Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island back in the day.

description:
  Some time during the 2050's, the world is a dangerous place as terrorists, drug
  czars, and outlaw states rule, using violence and subterfuge as tools in their
  push for global conquest. A deadly virus dubbed "gray death" is running rampant
  throughout the world and the only known cure is a chemical known as "Ambrosia"
  manufactured by the VersaLife corporation. However Ambrosia supplies are scarce
  and world governments, particularly the United States, carefully monitor and
  control who receives this cure. As protest against these events, French
  terrorist organization "Silhouette" bombs the historic symbol of friendship
  between French and American people, The Statue of Liberty. In response to this
  attack, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) organization is
  formed. Building a headquarters underground at Liberty Island, its mission is to
  attack terrorism and maintain peace around the world. JC Denton is a
  nano-enhanced agent who has been primed for UNATCO service. While JC's brother
  Paul is already an active agent, JC is beginning his first day of service when
  the National Secessionist Forces (NSF) suddenly raid a supply of Ambrosia at
  UNATCO headquarters.
  .
  Deus Ex is a dark cyberpunk game that combines gameplay styles of first-person
  shooter and RPG, with elements of stealth and puzzle-solving. The player assumes
  the role of JC Denton, UNATCO anti-terrorist agent. Pitted against an elaborate
  global conspiracy, he must interact with characters, pick up weapons and
  complete objectives. While JC is essentially fixed within the mission-framework
  of the game, he can be customized in areas such as weapons, technical skills and
  physical prowess. Completing objectives rewards the player with skill points,
  which may be distributed to increase JC's proficiencies in eleven different
  disciplines. The player can choose to increase the damage JC inflicts with
  various types of weapons, improve his lock-picking or computer hacking
  abilities, etc. Each such discipline has four levels of proficiency.
  .
  Another way of customizing JC is applying nano-augmentations to his body. These
  cybernetic implants bestow the hero with super-human abilities, and can be
  installed on different body parts, up to nine at the same time. Along with
  combat-related benefits, nano-augmentations also grant DC abilities that can be
  used to overcome certain obstacles within the game world. Examples of those are
  jumping to extreme heights, swimming, lifting heavy objects, etc. Weapons can be
  customized as well: their range, accuracy, and magazine sizes can be increased,
  and they can be enhanced by attaching scopes, silencers, or laser sights to
  them.
  .
  The game leads JC to various places all around the globe. The cities he visits,
  as well as most mission areas, are expansive and fairly open to accommodate
  different approaches to solving the same problems, depending on the player's
  preferred style of play. Most of the missions can be tackled in various ways,
  e.g. with brute force, stealth, or extensive usage of lock-picking and computer
  hacking abilities. At certain points, the course of the storyline can also be
  influenced by the decisions made by the player. Similarly to System Shock games,
  the environment is largely interactive, the player being able to pick up, use,
  and discard various types of objects.

genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Long ago a secret war raged between Heaven and Hell, each using humanity as its
  pawns. While the Prime Evils of Hell were engaged in war their lesser
  lieutenants conspired to overthrow them. They mutinied suddenly with the
  combined forces of Hell, overwhelming the three Primes. Stripped of their power,
  they were banished to the mortal realm. Human agents of Heaven, upon discovering
  this, found the three Primes and sealed them within gemstone prisons, each of
  them sent to a different corner of the earth and kept under guard to prevent
  them from escaping.
  .
  As years turns to centuries, however, the power of Heaven's agents waned, until
  eventually not even the people of the town of Tristram knew that buried deep
  under their chapel was the soul of the Lord of Terror, Diablo. As the strength
  of his prison waned Diablo reached out into the world, corrupting the dreams of
  the land's good king, driving him to attack his neighbors. The nation of
  Khanduras fought wars with no intention of winning, desiring only slaughter and
  suffering. Now the lands lay scorched, home only to monsters and the dead.
  Rumors spread of a way to stop the demons, as well as rumors of great wealth,
  and both draw adventurers from far to the small town of Tristram.
  .
  Players start by choosing their avatar's class: either Warrior, Rogue, or
  Sorcerer. Warriors have the highest maximum strength and can repair weapons and
  armor inside the dungeon, but this will lower the item's maximum durability. The
  Rogue has the highest maximum dexterity and can both see and disarm traps on
  treasure chests. The Sorcerer has the highest maximum magic attribute and can
  recharge the charges on a spellcasting staff at the cost of his own mana.
  .
  Characters can equip armor, weapons, and accessories found in the chapel's
  shifting dungeons, but strong equipment will have minimum attribute requirements
  to be worn. Most equipment will have randomized stats, but some strong monsters
  will drop Unique weapons with set stats. Magic can be learned by finding magic
  tomes, and leveled up by finding multiples of the same spell tome, but advanced
  spell levels can not be learned if the character's magic stat is too low. Upon
  destroying enough monsters to level up the player is rewarded with additional
  attribute points to distribute to whichever attributes they wish. Occasionally
  the few people left in town will inform the player of a job they would like
  done, either an exceptionally strong monster that must be slain or a unique item
  found deep in the dungeon, and will reward the player in kind upon completion of
  the quest.
  .
  Diablo can be played cooperatively with 1 to 3 other players over LAN or
  BattleNet with the PC versions, or with 1 player locally on the PlayStation.
  Players can team up to survive the depths of the dungeons, or turn on each other
  to steal one another's items from their corpse. The quest unique zones are
  removed from the online version of a dungeon, and instead quest monsters will be
  found wandering the level that would normally lead to their unique area.

  A group of scientists discovers an asteroid that is on its way to a collision

  veteran, is sent to command a space expedition on the asteroid. Accompanied by
  the journalist Maggie Robbins and the archaeologist Brink, Boston investigates
  the asteroid and finds a strange structure that undoubtedly belongs to an alien
  civilization. During the course of investigations, the team finds itself on a
  seemingly deserted planet. They have no knowledge of the planet and no
  possibility of going back. Will they ever discover the secret of this strange
  world and find a way to get home?
  .
  The Dig is a point-and-click adventure game with a simple one-cursor interface.
  Most of the puzzles are inventory-based, tending to be somewhat more complex
  than in most preceding LucasArts' adventure games. There are also a few
  logic-based puzzles, which require understanding and manipulation of alien
  technology and life forms on the planet. Traditional branching dialogue system
  is utilized; however, the game focuses more on puzzle-solving than on
  conversations to advance the plot.
  .
  The game's story is influenced by science fiction literature and movies, and
  strives to be realistic, departing from the comedy style of LucasArts'
  adventures. Despite that, humorous elements are present in some of the dialogues
  and text descriptions. The game utilizes hand-drawn graphics with a few
  pre-rendered 3D images.

developer: Larian Studios
publisher: Larian Studios
genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Divine Divinity is a 2D action role-playing game with an oblique (rather than
  isometric) perspective, set in a fantasy universe. The game borrows certain
  elements from Diablo series, most notably point-and-click action-oriented combat
  and item randomization. However, the game's locations are not randomized, and it
  contains many features of traditional role-playing games such as interaction
  with NPCs and multiple dialogue choices.
  .
  The entire game world consists of over twenty thousand screens, each one being a
  seamless transition into the next with weather effects as well as day and night
  cycles. The main quest progression is linear; however, there are plenty of
  sub-quests available, many with multiple solutions, and the main character is
  pretty much free to travel to most parts of the map right at the beginning. Also
  notable is the ability to loot almost anything, not just equipment or healing
  items, but also chairs, candle sticks, and pretty much anything that isn't
  nailed down (except tables).
  .
  In the beginning of the game the player selects between three character classes
  for the protagonist, each coming in two variants (male or female): Warrior,
  Survivor, or Wizard. Each of these classes has four categories of unique skills.
  For example, the Wizard can specialize in elemental disciplines or choose the
  path of summoning various creatures, while Survivor skills include, among
  others, pickpocketing and alchemy. Each class can learn the skills of other
  classes, and the differences between them are mainly the starting skills and
  stat bonuses as they level up.
  .
  The game features a random item generator similar to, albeit less extensive
  than, Diablo. Items at certain locations have fixed names, but the most
  attributes (like damage, armor rating, poison or stun effect, stat bonus, or gem
  slot) are randomized. The player can also improve their weapons by gems dropped
  from enemies, or bought from shops; the dedicated player may even embark
  themselves on the quest to find the legendary weapons.

developer: Rick Brown
publisher: Beyond Software
genre: Adventure
description:
  The follow-up to the original Lords of Midnight game uses a similar game system
  to its predecessor, but the story is now much more complex. Luxor the
  Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the
  evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of
  Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more
  characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish
  Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be
  turned back to Luxor's side.
  .
  The game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited
  amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions)
  and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground
  tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the
  area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less
  effective.
  .
  The characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey,
  Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't
  automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join,
  turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).
  .
  There are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game.
  Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many
  other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with
  practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the
  first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his
  death means total defeat.

developer: Kheops Studio
publisher: Microids
genre: Adventure
description:
  The game is played from a first-person perspective with the direction in which
  the player is facing controlled by the mouse. On each static screen, the player
  is free to look around 360o. The game's interface is very simple; there is no
  HUD, instead the player has access to an inventory in which all items are
  stored. From the inventory, the player can also access objectives, review
  dialogue and examine any documents they have acquired.[9]
  .
  To speak to people or interact with objects, the player must click on them with
  the pointer. As the player moves the pointer around the screen it can change to
  an arrow (meaning the player can move in that direction), a magnifying glass
  (meaning the player can inspect something in more detail), a cog with a red line
  through it (meaning the player must use an item on the object), a cog without a
  red line (meaning the player can operate the object without using an item) or a
  hand (meaning the player can pick the item up). When the player clicks on a
  person to whom they wish to speak, a list of conversation topics appear on
  screen. When the player picks up an item, it is automatically put into an
  auto-holder rather than the main inventory, and must be transferred manually
  from the auto-holder to the inventory screen. This allows the player to sort the
  inventory in any way they wish.

  Dracula 4: The Shadow of the Dragon is a 2013 point-and-click adventure video
  game developed by Koalabs Studio for Microsoft Windows, OS X, iOS, and
  Android. It was published on all systems by Anuman under their Microïds
  brand. In 2013 the game was released on GOG.com, and in 2014 was bundled with
  its sequel, Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy. Later in 2014, the bundle was
  released on Steam.
  .
  The game follows 2000's Dracula: Resurrection and Dracula: The Last
  Sanctuary, and 2008's Dracula 3: The Path of the Dragon. The plot is
  unrelated to Resurrection and Last Sanctuary, but is the first of a two-part
  loose sequel to Path of the Dragon, telling the story of Ellen Cross, an art
  restorer employed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When a precious set of
  fifteen paintings is lost at sea during a storm, Ellen is called to
  investigate when one of the supposedly lost paintings is auctioned in
  Budapest. Her investigation soon brings her into contact with Bram Stoker's
  great-grandson, a mysterious uncatalogued sixteenth painting, and the legacy
  of Vlad Tepes. The second part of the story, Dracula 5: The Blood Legacy, was
  released in November 2013.
  .
  Shadow of the Dragon received very little attention in the mainstream gaming
  press, with limited coverage from professional critics, and what reviews it
  did receive were negative. Critics were especially disparaging about the
  length of the game, the linearity of the gameplay, and the implementation of
  the health system.

developer: Techland
publisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment
genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Role-Playing;Sandbox
description:
  Dying Light is an open world, action horror game. It takes place in a zombie
  apocalypse environment, similar to the Dead Island games by the same developer.
  The game is set in the large city of Harran, with influences of ancient Turkey,
  overrun by a mysterious epidemic. The protagonist is Kyle Crane, an undercover
  GRE operative sent inside a quarantine zone. His initial mission is to
  neutralize the rogue GRE operative Kadir Sulaiman, but he can also choose to
  focus on helping the survivors instead. He can freely explore the city using
  parkour and freerun mechanics. The game has a dynamic day and night system –
  during the day zombies are less aggressive, so players can gather supplies,
  weapons, craft items etc. and prepare for the night, when infested are stronger
  and more dangerous.
  .
  The focus is on melee weapons and just like in Dead Island various materials can
  be crafted into weapons by gathering supplies. Also borrowed from that game is
  the stamina bar that prevents the character from continuously hitting. Guns can
  also be used, but sound attracts others. By progressing through the game the
  character's abilities can be leveled up in the skill trees agility, power, and
  survival. There are often large groups of zombies that can be taken out from
  heights, by pushing them off, using projectiles or triggering traps. Instead of
  stealth there is more focus on escaping using the parkour mechanics. Unlike
  games such as Assassin's Creed it requires precise timing and aim to grab ledges
  and combine slides and jumps into fluid movement.
  .
  Progress through the city is furthered by unlocking safe zones where zombies
  cannot enter. During the day Crane mainly needs to scavenge, locate and save
  survivors, explore, set up traps and locate air drops. At night the slow zombies
  become much more agile. They do more damage, can sprint and will chase Crane.
  Especially the Volatile creatures are extremely fast and deadly, changing the
  game's pace with more focus on stealth as enemies will easily catch up. The game
  becomes harder, but experience points are doubled at night. Aside from traps,
  sound and distractions, UV light can be used to slow them down. There is also a
  dynamic weather system.
  .
  Dying Light offers an online co-op mode for up to four players. In the Be the
  Zombie mode there is asymmetrical multiplayer where one player-controlled
  powerful Night Hunter can invade another player's game at night and up to four
  players can work together to defeat it.
  .
  On 9th February the game was updated for free to an Enhanced Edition version for
  all platforms through a patch. This Enhanched Edition then replaced the default
  version of the game.
  .
  The Enhanced Edition includes the follwoing:\n
  - Dying Light Game Enhanced (base game)\n
  - Dying Light The Following (expansion)\n
  - Ultimate Survivor Bundle (DLC)\n
  - The Bozak Horde game mode (DLC)\n
  - Be the Zombie multiplayer mode (DLC)\n

  Eschalon: Book I is the first title in a planned series of independently
  developed RPG games. According to the developer, it is a faithful follower of
  classic RPG series like Wizardry, Might & Magic, or Ultima.
  .
  The game is turn-based, with the outcome of every action determined by the
  character's stats. Those are aided by different skills that involve combat
  proficiency with various weapons, thieving skills, magic abilities and
  non-combat skills like cartography (affects the quality of the automap feature),
  lore or mercantile. The world is open from the very beginning, with nothing but
  overpowering monsters and thugs preventing the player from going wherever he
  pleases.
  .
  The story finds the player in an abandoned building in the ransacked village of
  Elderhollow, suffering from a memory loss and with a short note instructing him
  what to do next. In time, he finds out that he is located in the eastern
  province of Eschalon, Thaermore, which is currently torn apart by war with a
  mysterious underworld race of creatures bearing a strong resemblance to dwarves.
  The passage to the west was closed by the Eschalon ruler, so all the people left
  in the province now have to care for themselves. A series of notes and
  instructions brings the player closer to the truth about his origin and his role
  in the current conflict.

  Beacon, the disappearance of his wife Myra, and the death of his daughter Lily
  in a house fire. Drowning his sorrows in a bar, Sebastian is then approached by
  former partner and Mobius agent Juli Kidman, who reveals to him that Lily is
  still alive since Mobius faked her death, though Mobius now needs Sebastian's
  help in saving her. Sebastian is then brought to a secret Mobius facility
  against his will where he meets the Administrator, who further explains that
  Lily is being used as the Core for a new STEM system to simulate an idyllic town
  called Union. However, some time ago, Mobius lost contact with Lily and their
  agents inside Union, and they no longer have any control over the STEM.
  Sebastian reluctantly agrees to help Mobius so that he has a chance to save Lily
  and enters the STEM.

  FTL: Faster Than Light is a tactical spaceship combat simulator, however rather
  than commanding a ship directly, the player manages and commands the crew of a
  ship in addition to several ship systems (power, weapons, shields, etc).
  Navigating the ship across a sector of space is turn-based, but ship-to-ship
  combat plays out in real-time. The game can be paused to make it easier to order
  the crew about in the heat of battle. Crew members can be sent to different
  stations (ship rooms) by selecting a crew member and clicking on his destination
  inside the ship. The ship layout is presented in a simple top down layout
  consisting of various rooms and corridors. There are more things the crew can
  do, such as fight fires, seal hull breaches and defend against invaders who beam
  aboard. Crew experience plays a vital role in the long run, as only a highly
  skilled crew can survive the later more difficult levels.
  .
  The game begins with a rather basic ship (several other models can be unlocked
  by completing achievements) and several crew members with no skills. The mission
  is to escape the pursuing Rebel forces by navigating eight sectors and reach the
  Federation Base in order to deliver vital information concerning the Rebels. The
  game is quite difficult and just reaching sector 5 unlocks an achievement. Along
  the way, you may encounters friendly or hostile forces consisting of Rebel
  patrols, Federation allies, distress beacons and traders who can supply improved
  weapons or special ship augmentations. For a price of course. Eventually the
  Rebels will advance far enough into a sector to make escape almost impossible,
  so while it is useful to explore as much as possible, making sure you can escape
  intact is vital.
  .
  The entire universe is randomly generated each time so no two attempts will be
  alike. The player also won't know exactly what sectors they will have to
  navigate until they get closer. Most encounters are randomly generated as well
  though the game steadily becomes more and more difficult with each passing
  sector.
  .
  Unlocking achievements allows the game to be played with a different starting
  ship and crew. Some require a completely different approach. For example the
  Engi cruiser has weak offensive weaponry but can often disable enemy weapons and
  keep the enemy harmless while it either uses remote drones to attack or powers
  up it's engine and escapes.
  .
  Faster Than Light is all about tactics and planing ahead. Though it features
  many different weapons and ship systems, it's up to the player to come up with
  tactics that will use such upgrades effectively rather than just get bigger guns
  and fight bigger enemies. To win the game it is necessary to learn which tactics
  work and survive long enough to reach the Federation forces and help them defeat
  the Rebels.

description:
  A devastating nuclear war had wiped out almost the entire population of the
  Earth. The civilization, as we know it, has been destroyed. The Earth has become
  a huge wasteland populated by mutated creatures. Only small number of humans
  survived and they formed communities living on the surface, where they mostly
  scavenge what remains from the pre-war civilization. Some lucky people managed
  to reach safety of the Vaults, huge underground dwellings, during the war.
  Recently, the water purification controller chip in Vault 13 broke. Without
  clean water, the people of the Vault cannot survive. One person is sent to find
  a replacement chip and ventures outside to face a dangerous world, hoping to
  return within a hundred and fifty days.
  .
  Fallout is a role-playing game that utilizes a character development system
  called S.P.E.C.I.A.L., an acronym formed from the first letters of the game's
  basic character attributes: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma,
  Intelligence, Agility and Luck. In addition to having these attributes, the
  protagonist can also learn and improve skills, as well as acquire traits and
  perks.
  .
  Skill points are awarded when the player character levels up; traits are
  assigned during character creation, while perks are obtained every three
  character levels. There are eighteen different skills in the game, divided into
  combat, active, and passive categories. Combat skills include weapon
  proficiencies (e.g. small and big guns, melee, etc.); active skills are used for
  support or interacting with the environment (doctor, lockpick, science, steal,
  and others); passive skills are mainly dedicated to social interaction (barter,
  speech, gambling, and so on). Traits bestow various benefits upon the character
  while also imposing penalties; in contrast, perks are purely beneficial. By
  developing and customizing attributes, skills, traits and perks, the player is
  granted a considerable freedom in shaping the protagonist in his combat-related
  and social behavior.
  .
  The game has an open world which can be freely explored from the onset. Only a
  few quests are required to complete in order to advance the main plot; a vast
  amount of side quests is available. Thanks to the game's emphasis on social
  interaction, many problems can be solved in a non-violent way; in fact, it is
  possible to complete the game without engaging in battles at all, running away
  from enemy encounters and concluding the final confrontation in a relatively
  peaceful fashion. Conversely, the player can opt for a destructive path, killing
  everyone in sight. A Karma system is used to track the player's moral decisions
  during the game.
  .
  Combat in Fallout is turn-based. Participants have a limited amount of action
  points (AP) per turn; each action (including movement) depletes a certain number
  of AP, eventually ending a character's turn. The player can target specific body
  parts of enemies during battles. Characters may join the protagonist, traveling
  together and participating in combat as a party. Though the player

  The sequel to Fallout starts eighty years after its predecessor. When the First
  Vault Dweller was forced from his home, he walked north until he found some new
  friends and founded a tribe in a suitable place. But some years after his death,
  the tribe is dying. The Elders decide that one of the tribe members, the "Chosen
  One", must find the salvation, a universal tool called G.E.C.K. (short for
  "Garden of Eden Creation Kit"). Sadly, the hero's only clue are the ancient
  disks the Vault Dweller has left, and the only equipment are his clothes and
  PipBoy. With courage and determination the proclaimed Chosen One leaves to save
  his village, unaware of the consequences his actions will carry.
  .
  Visually and gameplay-wise, Fallout 2 is very similar to its predecessor. Combat
  and character growth are handled the same way, using the S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
  attribute system and relying on skills to customize the protagonist. The
  sequel's environments are more vast than in the first game, with more
  non-playable characters populating it. There are more varied dialogue options
  and ethical choices presented to the player during the course of the game, as
  well as new weapons, armor, enemies, and a few minor gameplay additions, such as
  a car the protagonist can drive.
  .
  Gameplay-related changes mostly involve the player character's companions.
  Characters who join the party can now level up, equip armor, and follow specific
  strategies, as opposed to the almost complete lack of control over party members
  in the first game. Some characters are also harder to recruit, requiring
  specific quests to be solved or a certain Karma level. Reputation system is
  added, which works similarly to Karma (good and bad deeds), but only within the
  same town or community.
  .
  The quests in the game are more numerous and typically involve more complex
  situations and larger scope. Fallout 2 introduces quests and moral decisions
  with mature subtext: the player can choose various lifestyles for the main
  character, including getting married and divorced, become a slave seller, a porn
  star, or join the mafia.

  Fantasy General is a turn-based strategy game set in a fantasy world with some
  steampunk/high-tech elements.
  .
  The forces of evil, in the form of the dreaded Shadowlord and his henchmen, have
  conquered most of the world. On the brink of defeat, the player (in the form of
  one of four heroes) is summoned as champion who will change course, free the
  world and defeat evil - or lose all.
  .
  The game features 10 unit types from four realms with lots of upgrades,
  complemented by a similar plethora available primarily to the opponent. Most of
  the game takes place on battle maps. Outside of those there's just a bit of
  basic recruiting, setting research priorities and financial managing. Battle
  maps are hex-based and feature lots of different terrain types that require a
  suitable approach - cavalry will rule on plains but is crippled in swamps. The
  player should build an army that is composed of the right mix of units and can
  adapt to new situations.
  .
  The game will look similar to players familiar with Panzer General since it uses
  a modified engine of said game.
  .
  The game offers two modes: the campaign against the Shadowlord or arena mode
  (single battle) against a computer or human opponent.
  .
  In campaign mode, the player selects one of four heroes, each with his or her
  special abilities and sets out to defeat the Shadowlord. The player must prove
  his or her own ability to adapt play style and army across five continents with
  different challenges until the player finally defeats the Shadowlord on Fire

  Orkiest of all clans, the Goffs, at his disposal, Skroll quickly swept aside the
  defences of Volistad and took control of the planet. Leading an army of
  Ultramarines and Imperial guard, you must retake the system and cleanse it of
  the foul alien by completing missions and annihilating the Ork forces. Though
  the Emperor protects you, you must remain vigilant, for like all Orks, Skroll
  loves fitin', so he and his forces will take you to the last man and space
  marine. Only supreme tactics and precise execution will allow you to reclaim
  Volistad in the name of the Emperor.

  Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await
  the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild
  master in a quest for glory and gold!\n
  Hillsfar is a single-hero role-playing game (in comparison to other Advanced
  Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games, where the player usually controls a group
  of characters). A combination of first person perspective (when traveling in the
  city of Hillsfar) and third person perspective (usually in some action-style
  mini-quests) viewpoints.\n
  As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated
  mission-based plot: fighter, thief, cleric, or magic-user. Each class to a
  certain extent, have different assigned quests given by each respective guild.\n
  In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various mini-games that are needed to
  complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master.
  These mini-games (and their viewpoints) include:\n
  Fighting in the arena (third person).\n
  Competing at the archery range (first person).\n
  Exploring buildings or mazes (top-down).\n
  Riding a horse outside Hillsfar while avoiding obstacles (third
  person/side-scrolling).\n
  Locking picking doors and chests (first person).\n
  Unlike most role-playing games, there aren't any randomly generated monsters to
  battle. In Hillsfar, combat only occurs in the arena.

  Unlimited Adventures allows players to create their own fantasy role-playing
  games, especially those set in the Forgotten Realms world, similar to  SSI's
  AD&D Gold Box series. The game is required to play the worlds created with it.
  .
  In Gold Box games the player typically controls a party of adventurers, leading
  them through cities and dungeons (presented in first person perspective),
  talking to people, finding treasure, buying things in shops, fighting battles,
  etc. When combat begins, the screen switches to a top-down perspective where the
  player can control each party member while they fight the opponent. This is also
  how games created with Unlimited Adventures look.
  .
  Construction Set\n
  The basic elements of each created game (i.e. design) are its modules, that is,
  the levels that the player will be travelling through. The designer builds the
  modules by arranging walls and choosing floors and ceilings. Then comes the most
  important part - setting up the events. The events control everything
  interesting that happens in the game: combats, text messages, Non-Player
  Characters (NPCs) joining/leaving the party, the party visiting a
  temple/shop/tavern, etc.
  .
  Unlimited Adventures comes with a lot of art, depicting various monsters,
  characters, items, etc. It is also possible to import own art. There are a lot
  of pre-made monsters (e.g. goblins, dragons, zombies, etc.) and humanoid enemies
  (e.g. brigands, bandits, evil mages, etc.), which the designer can edit freely.
  .
  Unlimited Adventures comes with a complete example design, "Heirs to Skull
  Crag".

game: Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/GOG/G/Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers (USA)/Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers (USA).json
developer: Sierra On-Line, Inc.
publisher: Sierra On-Line, Inc.
genre: Adventure
description:
  Gabriel Knight is a wise-cracking bookstore owner and would-be author. He is the
  last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight supernatural forces
  of evil. Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking moment
  scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key to his dark
  past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of the city. The
  police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel's friend. In the
  beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material for his new
  novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation, and
  plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.
  .
  Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure
  game. Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra's Quest games (e.g.
  Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its
  supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this
  way it is more similar to the company's earlier Laura Bow games.
  .
  The game's icon-based interface is the same as in Sierra's previous titles, with
  verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants.
  Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for
  classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically,
  Gabriel will have to interrogate other characters, choosing conversation topics
  and thus gradually finding clues and advancing towards the mystery's solution.
  .
  The game's locations are done in hand-painted style. The CD version of the game
  adds full voice-overs to the dialogues, as well as narrator's voice to text
  descriptions.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  This is the third installment in the shareware Geneforge series by Spiderweb
  Software. In this fantasy RPG, you once again play the role of a shaper. Shapers
  are a secretive group that are capable of magically creating life (in the form
  of mutant creatures) to follow their commands.
  .
  In this game you will face many challenges, and choices, after your school has
  been attacked and destroyed by rebels - with dozens of different endings.
  .
  The gameplay is very similar to to previous Geneforge games. You create your
  character by choosing from three main types: Shaper: specializes in creating
  creatures to do your bidding, Agent: specializes in using magic, and Guardian:
  specializes in traditional combat (swords, etc).
  .
  You then use a pool of points to distribute to all of your statistics and skills
  in order to create the type of character you would like to play. You control
  only your main character in the game, but through the use of "shaping" you can
  add creatures to your party to fight for you. Gameplay takes place in real time,
  but combat is turn-based, using an action-point system for each character and
  foe during battles.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  This is the fourth installment in the shareware Geneforge series by Spiderweb
  Software. Geneforge 4 is an isometric RPG with turn-based combat set in a dark
  and unorthodox setting that combines fantasy with unusual elements such as
  advanced genetic engineering.
  .
  The world is torn apart by a long-lasting civil war between an elite caste that
  previously held monopoly on creating artificial life, and a combined group of
  persecuted ordinary humans, genetically altered humans, and a variety of
  artificial creatures gone independent. Though the protagonist starts out as a
  rebel selected for genetic mutation using secret and risky rebel techniques, he
  is not restricted to only one side of the conflict.
  .
  The player may be joined by a several NPCs that would contribute to the plot and
  comment on situations, however, he is usually supplemented by beasts of his own
  creation that he can control. If his abilities are sufficient, the player may
  choose from a selection of fifteen unique and thirty modified creatures, each of
  which can gain experience and advance on its own. Geneforge 4 features a large,
  freely explorable world with a location system reminiscent of that in the first
  Baldur's Gate. There is a large number of non-obligatory and hidden locations.
  .
  A highlight of the game are its extensive dialogues with a wide variety of
  choices, as well as detailed descriptions of locations and special encounters.
  The plot is frequently praised by fans for its non-linearity, and the lack of
  emphasis on black-and-white morals. There is a large amount of side-quests, many
  of which are connected with the class of the protagonist, his abilities, his
  affiliations, or his behaviour in other encounters. Mutually exclusive quests
  are frequent.

  an elite class of highly specialized people that shape life into various forms,
  usually dangerous. The game offers six different classes to start building the
  character upon. As with the previous Geneforge games the player can put skill
  point emphasis in three areas: close combat, Shaper skills, and magic use.
  Compared to the previous game it contains a number of UI improvements and better

publisher: Empire Interactive Entertainment
genre: Strategy
description:
  Developed by Sick Puppies, Ghost Master is a strategy game with a difference.
  Your aim is to build up and control a team of ghosts, your goal to to scare the
  humans.
  .
  Set in the town of Gravenville, there are number of different scenarios to play,
  set over a variety of fully 3D envirnoments including the country house, police
  station and hospital.
  .
  Instead of playing with one single character, you build up an entire ghostly
  team. There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own
  personality - its own strengths and weaknesses. As the game develops the
  characters themselves will develop and grow. What's more, each one has its own
  unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood whilst others can
  cut the lights in the room...
  .
  Each time you scare a human or 'mortal', you will increase your plasm; the
  energy you need to scare them in the first place. Scare them too much and people
  will flee from the building, hence making your job more difficult.
  .
  Ghost Master has a true state-of-the-art AI engine which means the player gets a
  sense of natural human behaviour. The mortals will go about their every day
  lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with others... until they encounter the
  horrors you control! After these encounters they will become irrational, afraid
  and sometimes even go insane! As well as horror the game also contains elements
  of humour.

genre: Action;Adventure;Fighting
description:
  Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice draws inspiration from Celtic and Norse mythology
  to tell the story of Senua, a young woman and a Celtic warrior. The game mixes
  hack-and-slash action sequences with environment-based puzzle-solving and story
  sequences in equal measure. She suffers from psychosis, which causes her to hear
  voices, see illusions and often live in constant fear. Next to her mental
  illness there is also a darkness that haunts her, a source of power, but also
  something that affects and is shared by family members such as her father and
  mother, and her lover Dillion.
  .
  Almost all game elements and the way the story is told tie into the effects of
  psychosis, which was researched and implemented into the game with the support
  of both professionals in psychiatry and people who have experienced psychosis.
  Next to different voices that provide narration and play tricks with her mind,
  Senua is constantly surrounded by different voices talking through each other
  using different positioning with binaural audio recording. They also provide
  warnings during fights, for instance to announce an incoming blow out of view.
  The fighting only takes place in fixed locations against one or multiple
  enemies. Senua uses two types of attack, light and heavy, that can be strung
  into combos. There is an action to block and dodge, as well as a short focus
  attack that charges gradually and briefly slows down time, allowing her to do a
  lot of damage. Running can be done to approach quickly and launch additional
  attacks. Due to the shoulder-view close to the camera a lot of combat tactics
  are based around positioning and quickly switching between targets, optionally
  by locking on to them.
  .
  Many of the environments contain puzzles that need to be solved. There are gates
  that require runes to be located by finding their shapes in the environment, a
  sensation experienced by some patients when real life turns into a puzzle with
  rules and patterns. There are also illusions that permanently affect the
  environment, for instance by aligning Senua's sight to position loose pieces as
  a bridge. Other elements include light and darkness and portals with illusions.
  Optionally additional runes can be located to hear stories from Norse mythology.
  .
  The game is hudless. Enemies that are hit show damage through their bodies and
  composure, as well as their affected fighting style. The same applies to Senua.
  She can be knocked down a few times before dying. The game incorporates a rot
  system that grows slowly on her arm with each death. The game warns the player
  that once the rot reaches her head, the results will be permanent.

developer: Dennaton Games
publisher: Devolver Digital
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  Hotline Miami is a violent top-down action game set in Miami, Florida in 1989.
  The protagonist is a hitman, nicknamed Jacket by the fans, who receives messages
  on his answering machine from mysterious employers. Most of the game consists of
  various missions that always start in the killer's own apartment. He receives a
  new task through his phone and then hops in his DeLorean to drive to the
  location and do the job. After each mission there is a short story sequence
  where he stops by a shop.
  .
  Missions are always set in buildings with one or more storeys. Jacket has to
  enter and kill everyone inside. This can either be done in a silent way, taking
  out opponents one by one, or as a hectic sequence where everyone is attacked at
  once. When alarmed, usually all opponents on a single level will be drawn to
  Jacket. There are various ways to approach opponents. Enemies can be taken out
  with melee weapons or guns. They can also be knocked out by punching them or
  slamming a door in their face, but they will get up. When they are only stunned,
  Jacket can perform a brutal finisher or pick them up to use them as a human
  shield. Enemies include regular guards but also dogs. Usually there is no
  starting weapon and they have to be taken from the environment or from
  opponents. Some of these are specific to the location, such as a boiling pot in
  a kitchen environment. Other melee weapons are baseball bats, knives, crowbars
  and more. Guns usually have a limited amount of ammo. When taking out enemies
  silently, the field of vision and sound need to be taken into account. In
  certain missions, Jacket can hang on ledges to move on the outside to another
  part of the building. He also has to take into account glass and transparent
  surfaces as enemies can see and shoot through them. All weapons can also be
  flung at opponents, usually just stunning them, but only one weapon can be
  carried at all times.
  .
  After each mission a rating is handed out based on various parameters. Gathered
  points unlock new weapons (which have a chance to appear randomly during a
  mission), and new masks are unlocked after each mission and can sometimes be
  found and picked up during missions. Before each mission Jacket can choose a
  mask to wear. It provides a perk such as a starting weapon, faster speed, doors
  that kill, friendly dogs and more. Both action and gameplay are brutal with lots
  of gore and blood. Often a mission needs to be tried multiple times as a single
  hit is fatal. In levels with multiple storeys, completing one acts as a
  checkpoint. Jacket has the ability to preview the environment, but only slightly
  beyond his position, not all of the map. There are also some boss battles
  against a single character.
  .
  Control is done through a gamepad or the combination of the mouse and the
  keyboard. There are separate actions for movement and Jacket can also aim in any
  direction. Actions include shooting, throwing a weapon and dropping it. He also
  has the ability to lock his aim onto a single character. Missions are unlocked
  one by one and the apartment always has small changes tied to the story.
  Sometimes there are longer cutscenes. Optionally players can collect letters
  hidden inside the environment. These open up the Puzzle section in a menu where
  the letters can be ordered into a phrase. Once complete, the phrase can be used
  in a later part of the game for a different ending. The game's soundtrack
  consists of a collection of electro and synthesizer artists, from eerie
  soundscapes to a booming rhythm.

game: Mainlining (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/GOG/M/Mainlining (USA)/Mainlining (USA).json
developer: Rebelephant
publisher: Merge Games
genre: Action
description:
  Mainlining is a thrilling point and click hacking adventure that mixes dark and
  dry humour with a gripping narrative that will have you hooked from the very
  first case. Following the government's introduction of the BLU Pill Act and the
  Secret Intelligence Service's reintroduction of MI7, all online personal data is
  accessible by the powers that be. Mainlining questions techno-ethics and whether
  it is acceptable for an organisation to have the power to look at personal data.
  What if someone else got the key to that?
  .
  Mainlining and its BLU Pill Act mirrors what's happening in our own world. On
  November 4th 2015 the The Draft Investigatory Powers Bill was discussed in the
  British Parliament's House of Commons for the very first time. It's likely that
  the bill will be passed sometime in 2016, meaning that domestic mobile and
  broadband providers will be forced to assist authorities with gathering data and
  storing it for a year. The police and security services will have access to the
  top line of the UK's population browsing history, as well as knowing what apps
  have been used.
  .
  Referred to in the popular media as “the Snooper's Charter” and opposed by a
  number of civil and human rights organisations, the Investigatory Powers Bill is
  positioned to aid security forces in tracking terrorists and serious cyber
  criminals who use increasingly sophisticated online methods.
  .
  Mainlining is a refreshing take on the traditional point and click adventure.
  The entire game takes place on the simulated desktop of the protagonist's
  computer. Assuming the role of a newly recruited MI7 agent and working within
  the remit of the Blu Pill Act, the player must use their skill, judgement and
  cunningness to gather evidence by hacking suspects' computers and phones.
  .
  As a MI7 operative your primary objectives are to ensure the perpetrator's
  arrest and that the courts have sufficient evidence to hand out the longest
  custodial sentences possible. However, you'll also have to make judgements on
  whether the case you're working on is complete. Move in too quickly and you may
  miss leads linking your case to much higher profile cyber-criminals. Act too
  slowly and your suspect may detect you and escape.
  .
  In excess of five hundred known criminals are known to operate within your
  jurisdiction, who will you investigate?

description:
  After you finally defeated Lord Xeen in Might and Magic 4+5 (World of Xeen)
  among the ruins of Greyhaven you find a magic pyramid that seems to be the
  gateway to a new world. Nothing is known about the gate except that Xeen used it
  a lot, and thus the Dragon Pharoh sends you out to see what threat lies on the
  other side.
  .
  The gate leads to Havec, a new world filled with new creatures and dangers for
  Might and Magic veterans in this, a high-level, stand-alone scenario that
  continues your adventures in the World of Xeen saga with the same engine and
  gameplay mechanics.
  .
  Swords of Xeen is a role-playing video game developed by Catware and published
  by New World Computing. It was initially released in 1995 as a "bonus scenario"
  in the Might and Magic Trilogy compilation (the "trilogy" refers to Might and
  Magic III, IV, and V). Subsequently, it was also included in several series
  anthologies. The game was never published in standalone form.
  .
  The game began as a mod based on the Might and Magic V engine, which was
  released in 1993. Personalities from Catware were responsible for leading the
  modding effort, with story contributions from Ellen Beeman. As development
  progressed, collaboration with New World Computing was established, and the mod
  received publishing support.

developer: New World Computing
publisher: New World Computing
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he
  was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local
  adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them
  to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's
  actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the
  planet into its own sun.
  .
  Gates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series,
  and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to
  predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring
  vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat
  and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points
  rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.
  .
  Like in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute
  to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return,
  with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection
  features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several
  locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or
  races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to
  travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is
  introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as
  mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain
  messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.
  .
  Compared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various
  characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely
  exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in
  this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time
  periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long,
  the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will
  eventually die.

description:
  A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he
  attempted to destroy the world of CRON. However, the great battle between the
  guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra,
  where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the
  powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling
  nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of
  local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.
  .
  Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a
  sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing
  game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments,
  character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the
  same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the
  addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters
  may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.
  .
  This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring
  instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat
  from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option
  to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply
  by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap
  feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the
  game at any time.

  Enter the land of Xeen, a mythical place ruled by two villainous overlords.
  Solve many quests and puzzles as you attempt to unravel the secrets of the World
  of Xeen.  This special version of the game is really two games (Clouds of Xeen
  and Darkside of Xeen) rolled into one, with two differences:  One, your
  characters are able to travel from one game to the other, doubling the size of
  the world available for exploration.  Two, CD-ROM technology has made possible
  the use of digitized speech in all places that call for it.
  .
  Clouds of Xeen is the fourth installment in the Might and Magic series, and a
  follow-up to Isles of Terra. It utilizes the same graphics and interface as its
  predecessor, and is generally very similar to it in structure and gameplay.
  Among new features is the possibility to keep notes recording quests and
  important locations in the game, a separate inventory section for quest items,
  and two difficulty levels.
  .
  Darkside of Xeen is the fifth installment of the Might and Magic, a direct
  sequel to Clouds of Xeen, and a completion of the overarching story arc that
  started in the first game. The game uses the same engine and interface as Might
  and Magic III: Isles of Terra, and is nearly identical to its immediate
  predecessor gameplay-wise. Compared to earlier games, it has a darker and
  somewhat more bizarre setting, and dungeon exploration involves more
  puzzle-solving. It is also more plot-focused and has a larger number of
  cutscenes.

description:
  After the corrupt Guardian Sheltem was defeated, the seemingly never-ending war
  between the Ancients and the alien Kreegans entered a new phase. Meteor-like
  spaceships populated by the Kreegans fell onto the technologically less advanced
  planet Enroth. The local king, Roland Ironfist, plans to attack the
  demonic-looking aliens, but is betrayed by a mage named Sulman and gone missing.
  Xenofex, the king of the Kreegans, establishes a cult teaching people that the
  Ironfist dynasty has lost its Mandate of Heaven to rule the realm. Meanwhile,
  the town of Sweet Water is invaded by the Kreegans, and four adventurers become
  involved in the battle and the search for the missing king.
  .
  The Mandate of Heaven is the sixth installment in the Might and Magic series,
  and the first one with the playing area done with a real 3D engine, allowing
  free exploration of the terrain (as opposed to the grid-based movement of the
  previous games) and camera rotation. Characters and many objects are represented
  by 2D sprites. The gameplay follows the formula of the predecessors with several
  changes, the most notable of which is the option to fight in real time.
  Real-time combat allows free movement, while the traditional turn-based one is
  stationary.
  .
  Character creation is somewhat more restricted: there are no other races but
  humans to choose from, and the party contains only four adventurers. Six classes
  are available: Knight, Druid, Paladin, Cleric, Sorcerer and Archer. A new skill
  system has been introduced, allowing the player to manually raise character
  skills (e.g. proficiency in specific weapon types) when the character levels up.
  Characters also gain access to skills of most classes, regardless of their
  original class designation.

developer: New World Computing

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Eight adventurers were traveling in a spaceship, pursuing the Guardians Corak
  and Sheltem. The Guardians went to the world of Xeen, but the adventurers
  drifted off-course and crash-landed on the planet Enroth. There, they had an
  argument concerning what to do next, and split into two groups. About the same
  time, Archibald Ironfist, the brother of King Roland of Enroth, escapes from his
  homeland and arrives on the continent of Antagarich, becoming a new necromancer
  leader.
  .
  Meanwhile, a nobleman named Lord Markham announces a scavenger hunt on Emerald
  Isle. The first prize is the deed to the Castle Harmondale, and it is won by one
  of the two parties of adventurers from another world. From that point on, the
  two groups become antagonists, pursuing their own agenda and allying themselves
  with the local forces, attempting to change the fate of the planet.
  .
  For Blood and Honor is the seventh installment in the Might and Magic series of
  role-playing games, and a sequel to both the third and the sixth one plot-wise.
  It uses the same 3D engine as its immediate predecessor in the series, and also
  allows the player to generate and control a party of four characters and
  alternate between real-time or turn-based battle systems. As opposed to the
  human-only party of the previous game, the player can choose between humans,
  elves, dwarves, and goblins. The class and skill system from the sixth game
  returns as well, with a few minor adjustments.
  .
  This installment of the series places an emphasis on moral decisions, allowing
  the player-controlled party to ally with different factions and ultimately
  choose either a good or an evil path. There are also side quests in the game,
  some of which are time-sensitive and require the player to consult an in-game
  calendar. The card mini-game Arcomage is introduced as well.

developer: New World Computing

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  For over a thousand years, the races of the Ancients and the Kreegans were
  waging an interstellar war. Eventually, the heroes of the planet Enroth and
  their allies managed to stop the invading Kreegans. However, the Ancients would
  rather see an entire world annihilated than let it fall into the hands of their
  sworn enemies. A planeswalker named Escaton, serving the Ancients, arrives on
  the continent of Jadame and unleashes a great storm, damaging the borders to
  Elemental Planes. Terrifying creatures begin to invade Enroth. Unexpectedly, the
  fate of the world lies in the hands of a lowly caravan guard from Dagger Wound
  Islands.
  .
  Day of the Destroyer is the eighth installment in the Might and Magic series,
  and a sequel to For Blood and Honor. The game's engine is virtually unchanged
  from the one used in the sixth game, apart from a few minor tweaks. The biggest
  difference from all the previous games in the series is the player's inability
  to create an entire party. Instead, the player generates one character, while
  the others at first act as NPCs in the game world and must be recruited. The
  active party can hold up to five characters. Instead of the traditional classes,
  the differentiation of the characters is mainly manifested in their races, which
  include, among others, minotaurs, vampires, and dark elves. The player can also
  choose to ally with different factions and complete different quests for them.

  .
  As Miles wanders though the asylum he encounters various mental patients, both
  passive and aggressive. Stealth approach is advised, since if aggressive
  patients spot him they will try to hunt him down searching the area where they
  last saw him. Miles has no means to protect himself, but he can effectively hide
  behind and under the furniture, climb ledges and slide in narrow gaps. The only
  tool he has is a video-camera with night vision function that allows him to
  navigate dark places. Night vision consumes batteries which Miles must collect
  throughout the asylum.
  .
  At certain scripted moments the stealthy pace of the game changes and Miles
  finds himself hunted by the patients in runaway sequences reminding of the
  escape from the hotel in Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth.

game: Outlast 2 (USA)

developer: Red Barrels
publisher: Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment
genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Stealth
description:
  Outlast 2 (stylized as OU?LASTII) is a first-person survival horror video game
  developed and published by Red Barrels for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and
  Xbox One on April 25, 2017. It is the sequel to the 2013 video game Outlast, and
  features a journalist named Blake Langermann, along with his wife Lynn, roaming
  the Arizona desert to explore the murder of a pregnant woman, Jane Doe.
  Unfortunately, Blake and Lynn get separated in a helicopter crash, and Blake has
  to find his wife while traveling through a village inhabited by a sect that
  believes the end of days is upon them.
  .
  Outlast 2 is a first-person survival horror game that, like its predecessors
  Outlast and Outlast: Whistleblower, is a single-player campaign. It is set in
  the Sonoran desert. The game is also carrying over the found footage
  characteristics from the first game. The player controls the investigative
  journalist Blake Langermann, who investigates a dilapidated rural area in Supai,
  near the Sonoran Desert.
  .
  Langermann is completely unable to fight and can only defend in scripted scenes
  similar to the original Outlast, and can hide in lockers, crouch, run, jump,
  walk, vault, slide and climb much like the first game but the player has a much
  more limited stamina meter and must manage how long they run or else they will
  become slower and exhausted causing their pursuer to catch up to them. He only
  possesses a camcorder, which has night vision enabled, though the camcorder's
  batteries are also drained when night vision is used. Unlike the first game,
  Langermann's status as a cameraman means he has a much more advanced camera in
  his possession, one with clearer footage, zoom, and an audio detection system
  built into each speaker that can be used to detect distant footsteps and other
  noises but the camera is also equipped with an inventory system displaying the
  amount of footage they recorded. Spare batteries suitable for the camcorder are
  spread throughout the locations. Langermann also wears glasses, which limits the
  player's vision if they fall off.

developer: Ultra Runaway Games
publisher: Ultra Runaway Games
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Paper Sorcerer is a turned-based fantasy role-playing game, with a noticeable
  art style of completely hand drawn ink and pencil graphics.
  .
  The player takes the role of a sorcerer, once defeated by the four heroes of the
  king and now is attempting to break free from captivity with the help of an
  unknown ally. After the player escapes the cell room, the player now has ability
  to summon a creature to serve as a party member.
  .
  Summoned creatures have different physical combat and/or magic skills in
  addition to a limited selection of weapons, armor, and accessories they can
  equip. A werewolf for example, cannot equip any weapons (uses claws instead) and
  may only use light armor. A skeleton however, can equip longswords as well as
  light, medium, and heavy armor. As the game progresses, the player may summon
  additional creatures once a floor level has been completed. Only one creature
  type may be summoned in the party with up to a maximum of four party members,
  including the player.
  .
  Combat\n
  Turned based combat occurs when the player moves into range of an enemy, who are
  viewable while travelling. There are no random encounters. The party members,
  depending on their skills have a wide range of options, such as a normal attack,
  defending, and using a special skill or magic, both of which requires energy to
  use. Energy is regenerated by 1 per turn (or more if using a skill).
  .
  Defense is also a factor during combat, as a higher defense will thwart any
  direct damage to health. The amount of damage sustained once the defense is
  gone, is considerably high, although there are summoned creatures that have
  abilities to support the party's defense. Magic may ignore defense, however at
  half the damage.

developer: Ice-pick Lodge
publisher: Meridian 4
genre: Adventure;Horror
description:
  A Russian town, isolated for years from the surrounding influences of
  technology, finds itself subject to a terrible plague. The player controls one
  of three potential saviors, a government agent sent to the village (The
  Bachelor), an undertaker's son who has come to take over the business from his
  father (The Haruspex), and a young woman with mystical healing powers (The
  Devotress); the latter can only be played after having completed the game using
  one of the other characters. The three scenarios feature completely different
  missions, though their storylines are connected to each other.
  .
  Pathologic is a hybrid adventure game that incorporates elements of the
  role-playing and survival horror genres. The game world is viewed from a
  first-person perspective at all times. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to the
  exploration of the large town and conversations with its eccentric inhabitants,
  who will give the protagonist missions. Taking a cue from RPG quest design, some
  of these missions are entirely optional, while others serve the main storyline
  and trigger other quests.
  .
  The survival horror angle is emphasized by the various statistics the player
  should pay attention to. The protagonists get hungry and tired, so acquiring
  food and resting from time to time is essential. The protagonists can also
  become infected by the mysterious disease, which is demonstrated by a
  corresponding status bar; medications of various kinds must be applied to lessen
  or cure the infection. The game has a precise internal clock, and its characters
  might change their locations regardless of the player's input, which makes some
  of the quests time-based. Completing the main quests, however, is only one of
  the requirements for reaching the best ending; the game's time will advance and
  events will occur even if the player character sleeps through the whole game
  (provided he/she has enough food for that time). The town must be saved in 12
  days (game time); failure to do so will trigger one of the "bad" endings". The
  player is able to make moral decisions concerning saving characters or following
  one of the several leading groups in the game.
  .
  Combat in the game is action-based, following the FPS format. However, to
  emphasize the survival angle, all the three protagonists are rather clumsy and
  not particularly efficient in combat, and ammunition is scarce. Knives and other
  melee weapons can be used, as well as various guns. Weapons and clothes will
  become damaged and deteriorate; however, certain types of characters in the game
  will be able to fix them. Obligatory combat is rare in the game, though the
  player can kill any of the town's inhabitants, break into their houses, or fight
  criminals at night.
  .
  Economy and trading systems occupy an important portion of the gameplay. Prices
  in the shops will rise or fall depending on the current situation in the town.
  It is possible to sell any items the player finds in the game; however, another
  option is to trade them with the characters that roam the town. Depending on the
  character type, various trade possibilities are available, such as for example
  trading beads or needles that can be sometimes found in trash bins for valuable
  ammunition.

file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/GOG/P/Postal 2 (USA)/Postal 2 (USA).json
developer: Running With Scissors
publisher: Running With Scissors
genre: Shooter
description:
  Postal 2 is the sequel to Postal, the gritty, violent, over-the-top game that
  was the target of almost every politician's speech about violence in video
  games. Once again, the player takes on the role of Postal Dude, a normal
  (comparatively normal, anyway) guy living in Paradise, Arizona. The game is
  composed of a five day week, Monday to Friday, where the player must accomplish
  various errands. There is no time limit and errands can be done whenever the
  player feel like it. Errands range from getting a carton of milk (buying it or
  stealing it, player's choice) to cashing a cheque at the bank (either wait in
  line or kill everyone, again, player's choice). The game is as violent as you
  are, meaning the player can go through the majority of the game without killing
  someone or beating up someone, but can also go through it killing and
  decapitating every one the player comes across.
  .
  For killing needs, the player has a plethora of ways to dispatch people: kick
  them, urinate on them (making them vomit), shoot them, bash them with a shovel,
  throw gas on them and set them ablaze, leaving behind a charred corpse, and if
  the player wants to be stealthy, it is possible to pick up a cat and stick a
  shotgun into its rear end to use it as a silencer. One of the similarly over the
  top weapons is a decapitated cow's head filled with anthrax, which will cause
  everyone in the immediate area to gag, throw up, and eventually die.

  Cherokee Domasi "Tommy" Tawodi as he, his girlfriend, and grandfather are
  abducted aboard an alien spaceship known as The Sphere as it consumes material,
  both inanimate and living, from Earth in order to sustain itself. Tommy's

  Build and Manage A Maximum Security Prison.
  .
  Prison Architect is the world's latest Prison Management Sim. Starting with an
  empty plot of land you must construct a holding cell with basic water and
  electricity to house your first batch of prisoners, to buy you enough time to
  create a proper cell block. You'll need to hire some guards, get some showers
  built and unless the kitchen is up and running with chefs working away you're
  going to end up with a riot on your hands. From there you take your prison in
  which-ever direction you like. A monsterous super-max or comfortable center for
  rehabilitation, the choice is up to you.
  .
  .
  Prison Architect is currently in Alpha which means that the game is playable,
  but still in development. Not all features are implemented yet and there are
  many bugs that may affect gameplay. We are currently releasing monthly updated
  builds which include new features and bug fixes. By buying the alpha you will
  automatically be gifted a free copy of the full game when it's finished.

developer: Gremlin Interactive
publisher: Interplay
genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Puzzle;Shooter
description:
  Realms of the Haunting is a combination of first-person shooter and
  three-dimensional adventure game with quite a bit of live-action Full Motion
  Video thrown in to boot. Navigation through the game world is done through a FPS
  interface very similar to Doom; however there's also a free-floating cursor
  controlled by the mouse which you can use to interact with the various objects
  around you. There's also an inventory system and quite a few object related
  puzzles. The game has standard Doom-ish combat against a variety of monsters,
  however the combat is placed at intervals rather than throughout the game, and
  the emphasis is more on exploration and atmosphere.
  .
  The game's plot starts out as a typical haunted house story but soon mutates
  into an end-of-the-world tale combining New Age pseudo-philosophy and biblical
  Revelations. You take the part of Adam Randall, a pastor's son who is sent to
  investigate a haunted mansion by a mysterious priest who claims it's linked to
  your father's death. Once you enter the mansion you soon learn that not only is
  it infested with demons and evil spirits, but that the mansion itself is built
  over an old Satanic temple and the priest who sent you there is in fact a
  five-hundred year old French sorcerer trying to bring about the end of the
  world.You are soon joined by a helpful young psychic and aided by the ghost of a
  defeated knight. You'll also start a grudge with an ex-demon king as well as be
  chased around by the Antichrist-in-training.

  Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival horror video
  game. A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind
  Games.\n
  Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical
  and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable
  twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to
  that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the
  character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances
  the terrifying atmosphere of the game.
  .
  .
  The story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who
  reaches Richard Felton's house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of
  a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care
  of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary's true intentions, the
  dread begins.

  together.
  .
  .
  - Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn
  themselves into scary monsters.

  While investigating the activities of the SS Paranormal Division in Germany,
  B.J. Blazkowicz and Agent One have been captured by the Nazis. Agent One dies
  while being interrogated, but B.J. manages to escape Castle Wolfenstein's
  dungeon. He then fights his way out of the castle and uses a tram car to leave
  the area and meet up with a member of the German resistance in a nearby village.
  .
  The SS Paranormal Division under Oberfhrer Helga von Bulow has been excavating
  the catacombs and crypts of an ancient church within the village. Their sloppy
  precautions have led to the awakening of hordes of undead creatures, including
  Saxon knights, and the entrance had to be sealed off with many soldiers trapped
  inside. B.J. descends regardless and fights both Nazis and Undead until he
  arrives at the ancient "Defiled Church" where Nazi scientist Professor Zemph is
  conducting a "life essence extraction" on the corpse of a Dark Knight. Shortly
  before B.J.'s arrival, Zemph tries to talk Helga von Bulow out of retrieving an
  ancient Thulian dagger, but she shoots him impatiently and proceeds. This
  awakens a monster which kills her too. Blazkowicz fights the monster and is
  airlifted out, with Zemph's notes and the dagger.
  .
  One of Germany's leading scientific researchers and Head of the SS "Special
  Projects Division", Wilhelm "Deathshead" Strasse, is preparing to launch an
  attack on London using a V-2 rocket fitted with an experimental germ warhead
  from his base near Katamarunde in the Baltics. Blazkowicz is parachuted some
  distance from the missile base and smuggles himself in a supply truck. Inside
  the base, Blazkowicz destroys the V-2 rocket on its launchpad and fights his way
  out of the facility towards an airbase filled with experimental jet aircraft.
  There, he commandeers a "Kobra" rocket-plane and flies to safety in Malta.

description:
  A madman with power to kill millions has been discovered, and HUNT (High-risk
  United Nations Taskforce) has been dispatched to discover his plans. Your team
  was infiltrating his island stronghold when everything went to hell. The
  infiltration boat exploded and fire came from all directions. The only way out
  is in, into the the fortress, but to stay out here would be certain death. So in
  you go, guns blazing...
  .
  Rise of the Triad, a first-person shooter, is the successor of Wolfenstein 3D,
  with a somewhat improved 3D engine. Everything is still composed from blocks,
  but multiple vertical levels have been added; there are stairs made of platforms
  floating in air, and jump pads which launch you (and the enemies) high up so
  that you can walk over tall barriers in your way.
  .
  The game offers a lot of weapons. You begin with a pistol, but later you can
  find an extra pistol for John Woo-style shooting, and a MP40 rifle. All these
  weapons have unlimited ammo. You can also find more potent weapons - from
  classic rocket launcher, to quite wacky contraptions such as a "drunk missile"
  launcher or the "Excalibat", a powerful baseball bat. However, you can carry
  only one such a strong weapon at a time, and they have limited ammo.
  .
  Enemies are mostly humans equipped with various weapons. Their attacks can be
  quite varied; some of them can steal your weapons (though you can retrieve them
  after killing them), other shoot nets at you that trap you (you have to wriggle
  out, unless you found a knife, which will allow you to cut your way out). Apart
  from enemies, you'll be endangered by fireball launchers, rolling boulders and
  crushing walls.
  .
  There's a lot of power-ups you can pick up. They all have various wacky effects:
  for example, "God Mode" makes you immortal and allows you to toss homing,
  insta-death missiles; "Dog Mode" turns you into a... dog, which can fit into
  small spaces (and is inexplicably invulnerable to weapons); "Shrooms Mode" makes
  everything shine with bright colours, as if you were on drugs; "Elasto Mode"
  makes you very prone to bouncing off walls when you run into them.
  .
  ROTT also offers a lot of multi-player game modes; there's the standard
  deathmatch and "Capture the Triad", but there are also more varied modes - e.g.
  in "Collector" the players have no weapons, instead trying to collect as many
  "triads" as possible; in "Deluder", the players earn points by destroying
  "eluders" which move around the level.

  Riven is a sequel to Myst, and is very similar to its predecessor in gameplay
  style, controls, and visual presentation. The game world is presented as a
  series of computer-generated still screens; the player explores it in a
  point-and-click fashion. Interaction with the environment is possible only when
  said environment is highlighted as a hot spot, and is also performed by simple
  clicking. Like its predecessor, Riven is heavy on puzzles, which rarely include
  using inventory items, but usually involve understanding and manipulating the
  complex environments and machinery of the game world.

genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Hack-and-slashers tread carefully through the lands of Sacred, where the world
  itself is threatened by a veritable host of demons, set loose by a powerful but
  misguided sorcerer. A combat-driven adventure in the basic style of the popular
  Diablo games, Sacred offers a number of enhancements and unusual features that
  are new to the realm of action-RPGs. Players choose from six distinct character
  types, all with significantly different abilities as well as their own
  storylines and starting locations. These heroes can learn to ride horses and
  string together power combination attacks, and some may behave very differently
  as the game world cycles from day to night.
  .
  Playable characters include the burly gladiator, the agile wood elf, and the
  sneaky dark elf, as well as the angelic seraphim, the versatile battlemage, and
  the vampire, who appears as a noble knight during the day but commands the
  powers of her undead legacy at night. The world of Sacred is designed to
  encourage open exploration and freestyle progression, as the majority of the
  game's areas are accessible to player characters from the start. Each town in
  the game world is designed to have its own personality and player missions;
  characters who manage to accomplish all of a town's missions become true heroes
  there. Graphics feature 3D-rendered characters against hand-painted backgrounds,
  with three zoom levels.

  and Kinzie follow them to rescue their leader. There they'll meet old
  acquaintances (e.g. Dane Vogel and Dex) and historical figures (e.g. Shakespeare
  and Blackbeard).
  .
  Saints Row: Gat out of Hell is an add-on sized successor to Saints Row IV. The
  main difference to the main game is the lack of story missions - the plot
  progresses by doing enough side missions. When enough chaos is created, a
  cutscene starts and a new side mission type gets unlocked. After the third
  cutscene, the player is ready to face the end boss. Other major differences are
  the city (Hell is new, but smaller in scope than Steelport), the lack of
  customization (the player either controls Gat or Kinzie) and no licensed music.
  .
  Character development is identical to Saints Row IV except that new super powers
  are unlocked by finding and activating altars and flying works a bit different:
  Kinzie/Gat don't hover like Superman, but have giant wings. This causes them to
  slow down over time until they flap. They start with one flap per flight, but
  this number can be upgraded. While most distractions are known from the
  predecessor (but re-designed to fit the scenario), a few of them are new, e.g.
  shutting down factories by fighting over three control points. The four
  available activities are hellblazing (a flying checkpoint race), torment fraud
  (a insurance fraud variant), mayhem (causing chaos with a given weapon/vehicle)
  and salvation (husks fall from the sky and have to be collected by the flying
  player before they reach the ground).

developer: Artifice Studios
publisher: Artifice Studios
genre: Action;Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  The story takes place during the month of December in 1858 in 19th century
  Canada. Two feuding brothers must come together to save their sister from being
  possessed by the Devil. The writing is inspired by traditional Quebec and Innu
  folklore with story contributions by fictional writer Bryan Perro.
  .
  Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves is a blend of action and strategy around
  defending a cabin. It requires the player to plan ahead and then use quick
  reflexes to clean up the scenario. Through the clever and skillful use of traps
  in some scenarios close combat can be avoided. If close combat is required a
  rifle, an axe and your fear factor can be used to deal with enemies.
  .
  Players choose one of the two brothers that represent the games two levels of
  difficulty. The normal difficulty has Joseph with proficiency in close combat
  and setting traps and the hard difficulty has Jack with a dependency on
  strategic trap setting. The strategy elements occur at the beginning of each day
  where through a bird's eye view of the area surrounding the main cabin the
  predictive waves of enemies and their travel paths can be observed. This enables
  you to place traps to intercept and hopefully destroy approaching enemies.
  Enemies that reach your buildings will attack and eventually destroy them.
  .
  It includes a gameplay mechanic called fear factor where sources of light and
  shouting are some ways to increase an enemy's fear for you. The less an enemy
  fears you the more likely they are to get close and subsequently attack.
  Watching this mechanic closely is essential for crowd control if attacked by a
  large group of enemies. The game offers 20 scenarios, each taking place once a
  day between December 5th, and December 24th. The game comes with full English
  and French voice acting.

developer: Valkyrie Studios
publisher: TopWare Interactive
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Septerra is a world which is composed of "layers" - continents that spin around
  the planet center. In the center is the Core, a kind of a living computer.
  According to the legends, the Creator of Septerra left there a precious Gift -
  an artifact that grants the one who possesses it legendary powers. Septerra is
  controlled by the Chosen, who live at the top of the world, consuming massive
  amounts of energy and throwing the "waste" down, to lower levels. Maya, a "junk
  scavenger" who lives among those wastes and earns the living collecting junk,
  unexpectedly comes into contact with the Chosen. It appears that their goal is
  to reach the legendary Gift. Maya and her friends decide to face the Chosen, and
  ultimately discover the true history of the planet.
  .
  Despite its Western origins, Septerra Core is a Japanese-style role-playing
  game. The game's visual design is close to Japanese anime, and the emphasis of
  the game is on a character-driven linear narrative with simple role-playing
  mechanics. The game's story evolves across the seven worlds of Septerra, each
  with its own distinct style, including post-apocalyptic, semi-medieval,
  futuristic, etc. In the first half of the game the player-controlled party
  explores these worlds on foot, accessing towns and other areas from an
  overworld. Later the player gains a ship that allows fast transportation to any
  world, including previously inaccessible areas.
  .
  Combat is turn-based and takes place against enemies who either visibly wander
  around or appear at pre-set locations in hostile areas. There are no enemies on
  the world map. The action bar of each character is divided into three segments
  and is gradually filled. Opting for either fast and weak or strong and slow
  attacks, the player must select a character in real time, stopping the bar and
  pausing combat. Magic spells are usually awarded after completing plot events
  and may be combined with each other by two or three characters to create new
  ones. The player is for the most part free to form a party of three active
  combatants from a larger cast.

  - Shadow Warrior (base game)\n
  Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter similar in style and gameplay to Duke
  Nukem 3D. The game set in a generic "Asialand", which looks like China and Japan
  conflated together. It features deliberately immature and politically incorrect
  humor, as well as a protagonist who delivers regular one-liners, commenting upon
  the situation at hand. Much of the humor is derived from over-the-top,
  stereotypical portrayals of Asian culture (e.g. scantily clad young women drawn
  in Japanese anime style).
  .
  - Twin Dragon (expansion)\n
  Twin Dragon was one of two authorized add-on packs for Shadow Warrior that were
  canceled during development and later released as freeware.  It features a
  completely new single player episode consisting of 13 levels, three new
  Wang-Bang levels and more.
  .
  - Wanton Destruction (expansion)\n
  Wanton Destruction is one of two authorized add-on packs for Shadow Warrior that
  were canceled during development and later released as freeware.  It adds three
  new Wang Bang-levels, a Capture The Flag-level and a new episode: Wanton
  Destruction. This episode features twelve new maps; also, some enemies now have

description:
  Sid Meier's Civilization III is a turn-based strategy game where the objective
  is to rule the planet with the civilization of the player's choice. Players
  control one of 15 historic civilizations (Aztecs, Egyptians, Russians, etc).
  Each civilization has its own particular strengths and weaknesses -- some are
  more scientific, for example, while others have stronger cultural or military
  attributes; also, each civilization has its own unique unit, and is more prone
  to certain forms of government while shunning some others.
  .
  Like in the previous titles in the series, the point of the game is to expand
  the influence of a civilization through resource management, conquest, or trade
  with other civilizations. As game time progresses from ancient times through the
  modern era, a civilization will acquire new technologies, which in turn enable
  interesting new abilities and enhanced power. Since there are several ways to
  win (military, diplomatic, or cultural), it is up to each player to determine
  how best to manage the division of labor.
  .
  The game includes some mechanics and features which were introduced in Sid
  Meier's Alpha Centauri, such as borders between civilizations and the
  aforementioned differences between each civilization's statistics. The advisors
  are now present in the upper right corner of the screen in relevant menus.
  Diplomacy has been expanded, with the ability to trade and even slightly haggle
  with other civilizations in a more detailed way. Other new additions include the
  great leader mechanic, war weariness amongst the population, and small wonders.

  and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to
  approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the
  world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some
  will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can
  die if the Presence gets to them – and death is permanent. If they die, you will
  have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so
  their deaths are not in vain.

  As the Starfleet Lieutenant Alexander Munro returns to Alpha Quadrant from a
  long voyage, the authorities consider the Hazard Team that he had commanded an
  unnecessary luxury, disbanding it and assigning Munro to teach small unit
  tactics at the Starfleet Academy. Two years later, Captain Picard contacts Munro
  and offers him to reassemble the Hazard Team on board his space ship, the USS
  Enterprise. Shortly afterwards, the ship receives a distress call from USS
  Dallas. Apparently, members of a mysterious alien race known as the Exomorphs
  have attacked the ship. As Munro is sent to rescue the crew members, he is
  reunited with an old friend, and has to face dangers graver than anything he has
  encountered so far...
  .
  Star Trek: Elite Force II is a sequel to Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force. It is
  set in the Star Trek universe, chronologically overlapping with the last
  episodes of the Star Trek: Voyager series. Like its predecessor, it is a first-
  person shooter in which the player controls Alexander Munro (who can only be
  male in this sequel), who is usually aided by his AI-controlled teammates during
  exploration of the levels and combat.
  .
  Munro has fifteen weapons at his disposal, most of which have been ported from
  the previous game. Most of these futuristic, Star Trek-themed weapons are energy
  guns that have alternate firing mode. The tricorder reappears with a new
  function: the player must now actively use it in order to bypass security,
  participating in a power-routing mini-game, during which it is necessary to
  connect two nodes by manipulating a series of pipes.
  .
  During certain scripted events, the player can choose between two or more
  responses to a particular situation. These choices may affect the subsequent
  events and the level progression. There is also a possibility of a romantic
  involvement with one of the two female teammates.

developer: LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC
publisher: LucasArts
genre: Action
description:
  Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the
  Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility,
  he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base.
  This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various
  iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and
  firepower to turn the tide of the war. Dark Forces is a close prequel to the
  original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to
  enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the DOOM engine,
  like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi
  engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to
  look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark
  Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. The 3D models also make occasional
  appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or
  picking him up from each mission. Most levels have a fairly complex, often
  maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to
  change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as
  certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can
  use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark
  areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The
  player character is given a certain amount of "lives" per level; he dies
  permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only
  between missions. The game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to
  disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from
  the Star Wars movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to
  Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. As opposed to
  most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for
  Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to
  planting charges around a facility to demolish it. Cutscenes appear between key
  missions to update the plot. The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, as the
  game features imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen
  in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as
  weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark
  Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action
  scenes, with much of the music based off or directly replicating, John Williams'
  original film score. The game is entirely a single-player campaign; no
  multiplayer is included or supported.

  techniques of the Force. The evil Sith lord Jerec, who was responsible for the
  death of Kyle's father, is on a quest of his own, searching a mythical place

  be able to stop Jerec and become a true Jedi without falling to the dark side?
  .
  Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II is a sequel to Dark Forces. The game is
  set in the Star Wars universe and its events occur after those depicted in the
  movie Return of the Jedi (Episode VI). Primarily a first-person 3D shooter, the
  game also allows the player to switch to third-person perspective. Kyle can use
  blasters and rifles to take care of his enemies, and later in the game he will
  also be able to fight enemies with a lightsaber.
  .
  There are three kinds of Force powers Kyle may use in the game: light, dark and
  neutral. Light powers are mostly used for healing purposes; dark powers involve
  violent actions such as choking enemies or hurling objects at them; neutral
  powers enhance Kyle's speed and jumping ability. There are fourteen Force powers
  altogether; if the player chooses to develop only one type of powers throughout
  the game, a bonus power can be gained. Completing levels rewards the player with
  stars, which can be allocated to enhance the powers.
  .
  The game has a branching storyline with different endings, and the player's
  decisions can lead Kyle to the light as well as the dark side (for example,
  killing innocents will add "dark points" to Kyle's score). The game features
  video sequences with live actors as cutscenes.

developer: BioWare
publisher: LucasArts
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Four thousand years before the events depicted in the Star Wars movies, the
  political and ideological situation is not much different from what we have seen
  in the prequel trilogy: the Republic and the Jedi Order are fighting against two
  powerful Sith lords, Darth Revan and his apprentice, Darth Malak. It is said
  that the former was successfully defeated by the Jedi, and that Darth Malak
  betrayed his mentor and is planning to take on the Republic by himself. His
  aggression is so successful that some Jedi have decided to join his ranks. A
  seemingly ordinary soldier of the Republic is traveling aboard a space ship that
  is attacked by Darth Malak's minions. Narrowly escaping, the soldier meets a
  female Jedi named Bastila, one of those who have fought Darth Revan in the
  decisive battle. With her help, the soldier must learn to become a Jedi, stop
  Darth Malak, and discover the truth about his or her own past.
  .
  Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing game that uses the Star Wars D20
  rule system, which is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
  Character development and combat are handled similarly to BioWare's previous
  RPGs such as Baldur's Gate series. Combat engine follows similar "real-time with
  pause" rules. There are only three active combatants on the player's side (as
  opposed to six in Baldur's Gate). Several characters join the party and can be
  switched at the player's will.
  .
  Eventually, the protagonist will have to train at the Jedi academy to earn a
  lightsaber and force moves. Force powers include stun, force pull (which pulls
  opponents or objects toward the player-controlled character), the Jedi Mind
  Trick, which persuades people to see things the player's way, and many others.
  The player has various weapons at his or her disposal, from the lightsaber to
  blasters, grenades, ion rifles, etc.
  .
  Throughout the game, the player will visit many Star Wars locations that
  appeared in the movies, such as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees, the
  desert planet of Tatooine, and others. Interacting with characters in various
  ways and performing side quests influences the protagonist's stand with the
  forces of Light and Darkness. The player can turn the main character into a
  flawless Jedi, a ruthless Sith, or anything in between. Some of the player's
  choices influence major events that occur within the storyline.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Five years after the events depicted in Knights of the Old Republic, the Sith
  have become stronger and more determined to rule the Galaxy. The Jedi Order is
  nearly exterminated. A mysterious ex-Jedi has been exiled from the Order and is
  traveling alone. This Jedi had served under Darth Revan (when the latter was
  still on the Light side of the Force) during the Mandalorian Wars, but due to
  enigmatic circumstances was forced to retire. Now the past is catching up with
  the Jedi, and soon he or she will have to choose the side to fight on.
  .
  The Sith Lords looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, also being
  based on the Star Wars d20 role-playing rule set (which, in its turn, is similar
  to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons) and having the same combat engine,
  character development, and a Light and Dark ethical system, which judges the
  player's decisions and actions and influences story events and characters'
  responses. Additions to the gameplay include a lightsaber-crafting system, which
  allows augmenting lightsabers with various items, new Force powers, and the
  possibility to influence the alignments of the characters in the
  player-controlled party through conversation choices and other decisions. Most
  of the exploration and the combat sequences is done using a party of three,
  including the protagonist and two companions. However, certain parts of the game
  will force the player to travel alone, or to control a party made exclusively
  out of companions.
  .
  A large part of the military equipment can be upgraded using any workbench that
  can be found throughout the game world, including one available at all times on
  the ship that the player uses to travel between planetary systems. Different
  types of items have more than one piece that can be augmented. For example, the
  armor has two slots for upgrades (overlay and underlay), while ranged weapons
  have three (targeting, firing chamber, and power pack), and lightsabers have
  six. The easiest way to get additional upgrades is to either buy them or loot
  them, however they can be created as well at a workbench with the right
  components and enough repair skill. Medical items are a different sort and they
  can be crafted using lab stations.
  .
  At various moments during the game, the player has the opportunity to play some
  mini games: a card game called Pazaak, shooting targets using a turret from a
  first-person view, and swoop racing.

description:
  The game's prologue (and tutorial) concerns Ace's "family missions" in which his
  elder family members and Emkay instruct him in the flying of Corellian
  transports so that he can begin working for the family.
  .
  These missions reveal that the Azzameen family are in heated competition with
  the Viraxo and are generally sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance. Due to their
  sympathies, the patriarch of the family, Tomaas Azzameen, smuggles bacta for the
  Alliance in the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth. This causes them to pay dearly
  as the Galactic Empire raids their home station for running bacta to an Alliance
  outpost. The family subsequently seeks asylum with a Rebel task force.
  .
  As a Rebel pilot, Ace participates in a variety of missions for the Rebellion
  while also helping his family fight the Viraxo. During his tour with the Rebel
  Alliance, he proves himself to be a significant pilot as he participates in
  missions that uncover new Imperial projects, such as experimental TIE fighters
  and the second Death Star.

  In Fall 2008, Victoria is sent to Maine where Ellen Dunnigan's body has just
  been found. The modus operandi and the video sent to the police and press leave
  them in no doubt as to the killer's identity: the East Coast Torturer has struck
  again! No clues are picked up during the autopsy, as the serial killer
  painstakingly washed the body. Once again, the killer has not committed any
  errors.

  From her motel room, Victoria comes across a report by Paloma Hernandez, the
  journalist covering all the crimes bearing the East Coast Torturer's signature.
  Hernandez has been highly critical of the FBI's and Victoria's lack of progress.
  That does not stop Hernandez from phoning and asking Victoria to meet her later
  that evening. Hernandez claims to have some so-called clues on the killer in her
  possession. Victoria flatly refuses. Just moments later, Paloma is kidnapped by
  the Torturer...

  Still Life 2 remains true to the spirit of its first installment, but now allows

  Hernandez, the victim being hunted by the killer or Victoria McPherson, the FBI
  agent tracking him down, you can alternate between survival and investigation.

  Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse is a 3D action game that turns the
  tables on the age old tradition of zombie games. In this game, you play as the
  zombie, fight off the humans, and eat their brains. Stubbs the Zombie is set in
  a retro-futuristic city of the future and follows Stubbs over the course of one
  day as he zombifies the entire city.
  .
  Before becoming a zombie Edward 'Stubbs' Stubblefield was a traveling salesman
  in the 1930s who got himself killed. Flash forward to 1959 where the world's
  richest man, Andrew Monday, has built his dream city, Punchbowl Pennsylvania, on
  top of poor Stubbs' grave. Stubbs will have to claw through all of Punchbowl's
  citizens, including the local police department, crazy militiamen, nerdy
  scientists, and a deadly barbershop quartet.
  .
  Luckily Stubbs has some help. Every human that he kills comes back as a zombie
  and joins Stubbs in his quest for brains. Stubbs also learns a series of special
  body powers. He can use his unholy flatulence to stun enemies, he can throw his
  pancreas as an exploding zombie grenade, and he can detach his own head and bowl
  it into enemies. Stubbs' most powerful ability is that he can detach his hand
  and use it as a scout, climbing up walls and the ceiling, and then use it to
  take control of enemy humans and their weapons.

developer: Microïds
publisher: The Adventure Company
genre: Adventure
description:
  Syberia is a 2002 computer adventure game conceived by Benoît Sokal, developed
  by Microïds and published through The Adventure Company. It follows the
  protagonist Kate Walker as she attempts to wrap up a sale on the behalf of her
  law firm. In addition to the main plot, the game contains a dramatic subplot,
  conducted via calls received on Kate's cell phone, involving Kate's
  deteriorating relationship with her fiancé.
  .
  The game uses elements of art nouveau and steampunk fiction in its story. Most
  devices and tools, and even a train, are powered by springs and wind-up gears.
  Syberia was acclaimed by critics for its graphic design and intelligent script,
  and a sequel, Syberia II, was released in 2004, picking up where the first game
  leaves off. In 2009 Microïds announced that Syberia III would be released on PC,
  and possibly PlayStation 3, in 2010 or 2011.
  .
  Sokal's earlier game Amerzone is located in the same fictional universe, and
  Syberia contains some references to it. Another of Sokal's adventure games
  Paradise has no connections to Syberia but does use similar art direction and
  interface.

developer: Irrational Games
publisher: Electronic Arts
genre: Action;Adventure;Horror;Role-Playing;Shooter
description:
  In the year 2114, forty-two years after the events described in System Shock, a
  soldier joins the military organization Unified National Nominate (UNN),
  receiving the number G65434-2, and is shortly thereafter assigned to the
  military space ship Rickenbacker. This ship's duty is to escort the Von Braun,
  an experimental faster-than-light starship, on its maiden voyage. However, the
  next thing the soldier can remember is waking up in a cryo-tube on the Von
  Braun. It appears that both ships were infected with something so horrifying
  that nearly the entire crew was either killed or mutated into monsters. The
  soldier is contacted by a woman who identifies herself as the only human
  survivor. His first task is a rendezvous with this woman, for which he will have
  to traverse the monster-infested corridors of the ghost ship.
  .
  System Shock 2 is a hybrid of first-person shooter and role-playing game. In the
  beginning of the game the player chooses a career for the protagonist in the
  UNN. This choice grants bonuses to the protagonist's initial skills. Marines
  specialize in combat, navy officers can repair weapons and hack computer
  terminals, and OSA agents may begin the game with psionic powers.
  Notwithstanding this initial choice, the player may choose to learn any of these
  skills as the game progresses, spending acquired cybermodules to develop the
  main character in a RPG fashion.
  .
  As the hero traverses the corridors of Von Braun, he will have to avoid death at
  the hands of hostile creatures and robots on the way, acquire a variety of
  items, and complete missions to unlock new areas and advance the story. The game
  emphasizes survival rather than elimination of enemies; in many situations the
  protagonist is underpowered, and new enemies may appear in already explored
  areas.
  .
  Combat is done in FPS style, with both ranged and melee weapons. The ranged
  weapons can accept a few different types of ammo, each of them efficient against
  different foes, and can shoot in two firing modes. However, ranged weapons
  deteriorate quickly as the player character uses them, and will eventually break
  down after prolonged use.
  .
  Like in the first System Shock, much of the background story in the game is
  revealed by finding messages left by crew members before they fell victims to
  the mysterious infestation.

description:
  Following Garrett's previous adventure, the repercussions of his actions have
  changed the political landscape. The Hammerite religion has crumbled and a new
  leader named Karras has risen up to convert many of these fanatics over to the
  mysterious Order of Mechanists. Meanwhile, a new Sheriff has arrived in town and
  has been effective at cleaning up crime - maybe too much so. This is bad news
  for Garrett, whose profession of master thief puts him on the wrong side of the
  law. As the risk increases however, so too does the amount of treasure available
  to a skilled thief.
  .
  Thief II: The Metal Age keeps much of the same gameplay and abilities from the
  original Thief: The Dark Project, but also offers a few new items for the
  protagonist to use. Among them are scouting orbs, which can be thrown to see
  around corners and flash mines. The heart of the gameplay is still stealth, made
  up of Garrett's ability to stay quiet, stay hidden and keep signs of trouble out
  of anyone's view. Garrett's main weapons are his sword, his blackjack and an
  assortment of arrows, each with a special power. Each level features a variety
  of objectives as well as several items which don't belong to the protagonist,
  but are nonetheless valuable and can be stolen.

description:
  Master Thief Garrett is contacted by the Keeper Artemus, who wants him to steal
  two valuable artifacts. Meanwhile, Garrett learns that the coming of a Dark Age
  had been prophesied long ago. Gaining access to the Keeper Prophecies, Garrett
  learns that an ancient book known as the Compendium of Reproach contains more
  information about the prophecy. As Garrett is trying to solve the mystery, it
  becomes more and more clear to him that there is a traitor in the order of the
  Keepers.
  .
  Thief: Deadly Shadows is the third installment in the Thief series. The game
  follows the same design philosophy and gameplay structure that distinguished its
  predecessors. As before, stealth is the key to successful completion of
  missions. Avoiding confrontation with the guards, Garrett has to make his way
  through the levels towards the objective. Shadows and sounds play a large role,
  as guards will react to suspicious noises, and studying their patrolling
  routines is essential.
  .
  A few gameplay elements have been slightly altered. Garrett can no longer swim,
  but is able to use climbing gloves that attach him to the walls. He can also
  flatten himself against walls while standing; if in shadow, he remains
  completely unnoticeable that way. The player can see Garrett's limbs even if he
  is viewed from first-person perspective, allowing more precise movements.
  Switching to third-person view is also possible.
  .
  The most significant gameplay change is the non-linear exploration of the City,
  which has been added to the largely linear missions. In order to access the next
  mission, Garrett has to explore the City. On his way, he can overhear
  conversations, steal valuables, avoid or knock out the guards, and even accept
  secondary missions, which will influence his reputation with some of its
  factions.

description:
  Thief Gold is a reissue of the game, Thief: The Dark Project, updated to version
  1.37. Thief Gold includes three entirely new campaign missions which deepen the
  plot and provide new challenges, as well as five new types of enemies to
  overcome. Some of the original Thief levels have had minor modifications, to
  include bugfixes, small design changes and the new enemies.
  .
  Garrett, discovered on the streets as a beggar, is taken in and trained by the
  secretive organization known as the Keepers. However, Garrett's plans for his
  training is different than that of his masters and so Garrett soon parts
  company. Surfacing as a master thief, Garrett must enter forbidden places and
  appropriate the treasures of the rich and the powerful. Of course this line of
  work is offensive to many people including the rich nobles, the town guard and
  the religious order of the Hammerites. If Garrett can keep his head while he
  relieves these forces of their valuable trinkets, he should be able to do quite
  well....
  .
  Thief: The Dark Project is a first person game focused on stealth. It is set in
  a metropolis called "the City", a medieval fantasy world with some elements from
  the industrial revolution era of technology. Garrett's main skills are in using
  the shadows to avoid being seen (the level of visibility indicated by a "light
  gem") and to avoid being heard (different surfaces make different noises).
  Guards can be alerted by either, and remaining hidden is ever important.
  Entering combat against armed opponents is not recommended, though some enemies
  (notably the various undead) can be taken on directly or avoided. It is also
  possible to silently sneak on guards, incapacitate them with the blackjack,
  steal their keys, and move their bodies.
  .
  At Garrett's disposal is a wide range of equipment, including lockpicks, a
  blackjack, a sword, flash bombs, holy water, explosive mines, and a bow which
  fires normal arrows in addition to water, fire, moss, rope, and noisemaker
  arrows. Each type of arrows has a unique purpose: water extinguishes torches,
  moss covers the ground to soften the sounds of footsteps, ropes can be used to
  climb in certain spots or cross chasms, etc.
  .
  The levels in the game are fairly open, and most of the time there are several
  paths and ways to accomplish the objective. Certain objects can be interacted
  with, moved from place to place, or destroyed. The game has three difficulty
  levels distinguished by the amount of goals needed to fulfill. Lower difficulty
  levels may allow the player to skip some of the harder areas due to the lack of
  a mission objective leading there. On higher difficulties, additional
  requirements (such as completely non-lethal way of finishing a stage) may be
  added. Loot gained from Garrett's thieving can be used to purchase additional
  equipment for the mission ahead.

  Through the Woods is a third-person Norse horror adventure set in a forest on

description:
  Two friends, Gagwin and Baggus, along with Gagwin's son, went on a search for
  the 12 legendary treasures once gathered by the hero Huayin to defeat a demon.
  After gathering all treasures, they've arrived at an island with a temple which
  can only be opened by said treasures and which was said to hold great riches.
  The trio enters the temple and what happens next is yet to be revealed...
  .
  Treasure Adventure Game is a platform game developed as a tribute to 8-bit era
  games. The player controls the boy 10 years after he arrived at the island, when
  his adoptive grandmother sends him into an adventure: gather the same 12
  treasures as his father once did. The game features a huge side scrolling world
  comprised of several islands, which were once a single continent. The islands
  can be explored in a non-linear fashion, with new areas being made accessible by
  the collection of new items. The boy has a hook for a hand, and uses it as a
  weapon. He can crawl to cross lowered passages, jump and grab onto ledges and
  hanging vines or chains with his hook. When traveling from one island to
  another, he uses a boat, which can be latter equipped with a sail and a cannon.
  .
  Each treasure is hidden somewhere in the map, and the player must first find
  maps which will point to the right X and Y coordinates where they can be found.
  Using a compass, the player can travel precisely to those coordinates. Some
  other items are also hidden and can be found by the use of maps. Some maps and
  items are locked into chests, which will require lockpicks to be unlocked. Money
  can be collected and used to buy new items. The game also features a day and
  night cycle, with areas only being reachable in certain times of the day (such
  as a store which only opens from 5 to 16 and night club which only has shows at
  night).

  Tyrian 2000 is a direct re-release of the original action smash, Tyrian. It is
  essentially the same game with an additional new episode (Hazudra Fodder), a
  revised engine (less bugs and better controls) and added Windows support. It
  also adds another option called "Timed Battle".
  .
  Tyrian is nothing like your run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up. It gained a following
  even larger than the classic Raptor: Call of the Shadows, and rightfully so: it
  has a plot. A plot, you ask? Yes. And even a complex one. You play the role of
  Trent Hawkings, this galaxy's ace solo fighter-pilot, whose luck forces him to
  save the galaxy, one time after another. Again and again, Trent must fight off
  MicroSol, a company with the evil intent of taking over the galaxy. Through your
  struggles, you will find yourself again and again betrayed by friends and
  allies, your parents will be killed and you will have to return to points you've
  already been to (with variations on the levels) in order to remove further
  threats to the galaxy and to yourself, all for the ultimate goal of overthrowing
  MicroSol.
  .
  Tyrian also has two player arcade mode and supports network/modem/serial play.
  It features a multi-layered ship upgrade engine, in which you can change hulls,
  decide upon and upgrade your front and rear weapons, buy better shields and
  generators and even add ship "sidekicks". Tyrian's complete arsenal amound to
  over a dozen type of ships and over 100 weapon types!

description:
  Ultima II: The Revenge of the Enchantress, released on August 24, 1982 (USCO#
  PA-317-502), is the second role-playing video game in the Ultima series.
  .
  It was also the only official Ultima game published by Sierra On-Line.
  Controversy with Sierra over royalties for the PC port of this game led the
  series creator Richard Garriott to start his own company, Origin Systems.
  .
  The gameplay is very similar to the previous game in the series, Ultima. The
  scope of the game is bigger, in that there are several more places to explore,
  even though some of them (like most of the solar system planets and the dungeons
  and towers) are optional and not required to complete the game.
  .
  In the game, the player has to travel to several different time periods of
  Earth, using time doors. The periods are the Time of Legends (a mythological
  period), Pangea (about 300 to 250 million years ago), B.C. (1423, "before the
  dawn of civilization"), A.D. (1990), and the Aftermath (after 2112).

publisher: ORIGIN Systems, Inc.
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Ultima III: Exodus is the third game in the Ultima series. Exodus is also the
  name of the game's principal antagonist. Released in 1983, it was the first
  Ultima game published by Origin Systems. Originally developed for the Apple II,
  Exodus was eventually ported to 13 other platforms, including a NES/Famicom
  remake.
  .
  Exodus featured revolutionary graphics for its time, as one of the first
  computer RPGs to display animated characters. Also, Exodus differs from previous
  games in that players now direct the actions of a party of four characters
  rather than just one. During regular play the characters are represented as a
  single player icon and move as one. However, in battle mode, each character is
  represented separately on a separate "battle screen" and the player alternates
  commands between each character in order, followed by each enemy character
  having a turn. Thus the player must understand weapons and magic commands and
  employ rudimentary tactics in order to overcome each opponent. This differs from
  the two previous games in the Ultima series in which the player is simply
  depicted as trading blows with one opponent on the main map until either is
  defeated. Enemies on the overworld map can be seen and at least temporarily
  avoided, while enemies in a dungeon may appear randomly without any forewarning.

  Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, first released in 1985 for the Apple II, is the
  fourth in the series of Ultima role-playing video games. It is the first in the
  "Age of Enlightenment" trilogy, shifting the series from the hack and slash,
  dungeon crawl gameplay of its "Age of Darkness" predecessors towards an
  ethically-nuanced, story-driven approach. In 1996 Computer Gaming World named
  Ultima IV as #2 on its Best Games of All Time list on the PC. Designer Richard
  Garriott considers this game to be among his favorites from the Ultima series.
  .
  Ultima IV is among the few computer role-playing games, and perhaps the first,
  in which the game's story does not center on asking a player to overcome a
  tangible ultimate evil.

  Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny (1988) is the fifth entry in the role-playing
  video game series Ultima.  After having mastered the eight Virtues, attaining
  Avatarhood and retrieving the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom in the previous game, the
  Avatar is summoned back to Britannia by his old comrades Iolo and Shamino using
  a magic coin, which was included as a trinket in the game's box. Upon arrival he
  is greeted by Shamino but they immediately come under attack from the three
  powerful beings known as the Shadowlords.
  .
  Warriors of Destiny featured much more polished writing (earlier games were
  riddled with some spelling errors and uneven vocabulary) and considerably
  greater detail than previous games. It was the first Ultima to implement a
  time-of-day system in which the sun rises and sets, and non-player characters
  follow daily routine schedules. This game has been lauded as realistically
  portraying a culture living under a dictatorial regime; its tone is much darker
  than that of Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar.

description:
  This re-release contains the original game "Ultima VII: Part Two - Serpent
  Isle", along with the expansion, "The Silver Seed."
  .
  This game takes place 18 months after Ultima VII: The Black Gate. Batlin, the
  leader of the Fellowship has disappeared, as well as Iolo's wife Gwenno. A map
  is found that points to the Serpent Isle where the Guardian is still planning to
  destroy Britannia. Lord British sends you, the Avatar, and your companions to
  this new land. Once there, you discover that a great imbalance is upon the isle
  and it is up to you to fix it. To do so, you must learn the philosophies of the
  original inhabitants of this land who worshiped giant serpents symbolizing the
  principles of Order, Chaos and Balance.
  .
  Serpent Isle uses virtually the same game engine as the first Ultima 7, with
  some slight modifications in inventory managment and NPC portraits. The story
  however, is more linear and also more extensive. In typical Ultima-style there's
  lots of dialogue with NPCs next to the usual fighting, puzzles and magic.
  .
  The Silver Seed was an add-in disk for Ultima VII, Part Two: Serpent Isle. It
  added a new scenario with 5 quests, in which the player has to go back in time
  to find the silver seed which would heal the lands. In order to fit in with the
  original story line, these quests needed to be completed before finishing the
  original game.
  .
  The main appeal of the game was a few useful items such as a key-ring for
  storing the many keys could be found and a few interface improvements such as
  new hotkeys.

  The Gold CD-ROM version includes both Pagan: Ultima VIII and the optional Pagan:
  Ultima VIII - Speech Pack.\n
  A speech pack was released separately, which added voices to some of the major
  game characters. It was included in the CD-ROM edition of the game. Pagan:
  Ultima VIII - Speech Pack is an add-on to Pagan: Ultima VIII, which adds voices
  to some of the key characters in the game such as the Guardian and the Titans.
  The speech pack was available in English, German and French.
  .
  Ultima VIII: Pagan begins where Ultima VII: Part Two - Serpent Isle ended. The
  Guardian banishes the Avatar to the land of Pagan, a world under his control.
  Stranded in this unknown land, without his companions to help him, the Avatar's
  goal is to find a way back to Britannia. He has to confront four Titans in this
  world who are embodiments of the four elements, as well as master different
  styles of magic and fight many opponents on his way.

genre: Action;Adventure;Role-Playing
description:
  For the last time, the Avatar is being summoned to free Britannia from
  Guardian's curse. The eight Shrines of Virtues, the pride of Britannia, have
  been all desecrated by this evil and mysterious creature. The glyphs which
  protected them have been taken, and put into huge columns the Guardian built in
  Britannia, with their entrances hidden deep in dangerous dungeons. As a result,
  the people of Britannia have lost their virtues. The Avatar must now cleanse the
  shrines and let the virtues return to the people. His task becomes particularly
  difficult because he cannot trust the people he encounters any more. With the
  help of a few allies, the Avatar will have to help the inhabitants of Britannia,
  and learn about the true origin of the Guardian.
  .
  Ultima IX: Ascension is the last single-player installment of the Ultima series,
  and the conclusion of its overarching story. The game still contains
  role-playing elements such as the series' traditional character creation based
  on ethically ambiguous questions, a quest-based structure (including side
  quests), a large world to explore, heavy inventory management, financial system,
  as well as weapon and armor customization. However, the game has no experience
  points system; the protagonist's basic attributes are increased only after
  completing certain storyline events.
  .
  Similarly to the previous installment, the combat in the game is
  action-oriented, and the protagonist has no companions that would help him in
  battles. The Avatar can use melee and ranged weapons (bows) or magic spells to
  dispose of his foes. The puzzle-oriented structure of the dungeons further
  emphasizes the game's tendency towards action-adventure gameplay not dissimilar
  to Zelda games.
  .
  The game features support for EAX sound and a fully 3D world with an almost
  unrestricted freedom of movement: in addition to climbing and jumping, which the
  Avatar has "learned" in the previous game, he can also swim and dive; some
  well-hidden locations can only be accessed in this way. The physical
  interactivity with the game world has been preserved; almost every object can be
  moved from place to place or taken into the Avatar's inventory.

  .
  Only by surviving the dangers of the Abyss and finding the villain who abducted
  Arial can you restore your good name. But dark hints garnered from all corners
  of the Abyss reveal that this was no simple kidnapping. The fate of Britannia
  hangs in the balance as you battle the horrors that lurk as the heart of the

  Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds takes place one year after the events
  of Ultima VII: The Black Gate. To celebrate the defeat of the Guardian, Lord
  British invites the Avatar and his companions to his castle. However, in the
  night of the feast the Guardian attacks again, encasing the castle in a giant
  gem of blackrock. Deep in the sewers of the castle, another blackrock gem is
  found, created as an aftereffect of the attack. This gem is a teleporter to
  other worlds controlled by the Guardian. Now the Avatar must travel to these
  worlds in order to free the castle from the Guardian's spell.
  .
  This sequel to Ultima Underworld plays almost exactly as the original, with its
  3D world, action-oriented combat, magic system and multiple-choice
  conversations. The player creates the character of Avatar, choosing gender,
  class, and initial skills. These range from weapon proficiencies to social
  abilities such as diplomacy and bartering. Some of the skills can be increased
  during the course of the game by visiting trainers. After having accumulated a
  sufficient amount of experience points, the Avatar levels up, and his hit points
  and mana are increased. Like its predecessor, the game features an interactive
  world: many objects can be manipulated and physically moved.
  .
  The game's storyline is more connected to the main Ultima series than that of
  its predecessor, and the game world is larger and has more variety: besides the
  usual castles and dungeons there are such diverse locations as an ice world, an
  alien place called Talorus and the enigmatic Ethereal Void. Graphics and sound
  have also been improved: the size of the viewing window has been increased,
  there are new monster graphics and the game now features digitized sound
  effects.

  Doom") is an updated version of Doom released on April 30, 1995, that adds a
  fourth nine-level episode, Thy Flesh Consumed, which contains seven regular
  levels, one secret level, and one boss level. This enhanced version was made as
  an incentive in the distribution of the boxed game through retail stores and

  Doom version 1.9 to The Ultimate Doom.

description:
  Some years after the Strider Wars, humanity has resumed its expansion into
  space. On the rough frontier, it falls to the Terran Colonial Authority to
  maintain peace and order among the outlying colonies and outposts. TCA Marshal
  John Dalton and the crew of his ship, the Atlantis, patrol this dangerous sector
  of space when several distress calls lead to the discovery of alien artifacts
  with unique properties. Soon, the hunt for these artifacts is on between several
  alien factions as well as human corporations and their mercenary forces, with
  the TCA and their allies caught in the middle.
  .
  The first-person shooter Unreal II, while a sequel to Unreal, has no direct
  connection to the first game except being set in the same universe (with the
  Skaarj from Unreal and the Liandri Corporation from Unreal Tournament being
  major enemy factions). The player controls John Dalton through a dozen missions,
  taking place in such locations as the dense jungle of a tropical planet, a
  research facility on a frozen moon, the insides of a planet-sized living
  organism, the home world of an insectoid machine civilization, as well as a huge
  starship.
  .
  The weapon arsenal consists of more than a dozen guns. Standard types include
  pistols, an assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. Some heavier ones are a
  flame thrower, as well as rocket and grenade launchers, with the grenade
  launcher being able to use six different ammunition types, including
  fragmentation, EMP and smoke grenades. Available in later missions are weapons
  adapted from alien technologies. These include various energy guns, a biological
  weapon that creates living spiders that attack enemies, and an autonomous
  floating orb that either seeks out and attacks enemies or circles around the
  player in point defense. As in other Unreal titles, each weapon has two
  different firing modes.
  .
  Missions are usually of the run-and-gun type, but there are exceptions. Several
  levels include defense assignments where either a position must be held for a
  certain time or a character be kept alive. These levels usually include
  additional tools such as energy barriers and automated turrets that can be
  placed by the player in any location. Sometimes, AI-controlled characters will
  be there to help out the player as well. In that case they can be given orders
  on which sector to defend or patrol, for example.
  .
  The story of the game is told through a variety of means: besides in-engine
  cutscenes, there is a lot of radio chatter during a mission; in fact, it's not
  unusual for mission objectives to completely change due to story developments.
  Between missions, Dalton can wander freely about the Atlantis and chat with his
  crew, going into their personal backstories as well as more details about the
  main plot.

  when an unplanned course change led to it being caught in the gravity well of an
  uncharted planet. Not many aboard survive the crash landing, and those that do
  find this new world to be one full of strange beauty, but also many dangers. Not
  only is it full of dangerous wildlife, but it is the setting of a conflict
  between the ruthless Skaarj and the peaceful natives they have enslaved, the
  Nali. As one of the surviving prisoners, the player must escape the wreckage of
  the Rikers, navigate through Nali villages and temples, Skaarj mines and
  refineries, other crashed ships and many more locations, with the ultimate goal
  of finding a way off the planet.
  .
  Unreal is a first-person shooter. Its story is mostly told through short text
  messages, deciphered via a translator from computer stations, personal logs,
  books and signs. The game features a weapon arsenal of ten guns, each with two
  firing modes. Besides standard pistols, rocket/grenade launchers, miniguns and
  sniper rifles, there are such items as the Bio Rifle, which fires blobs of toxic
  waste which stick to walls and enemies, the Flak Cannon, which sprays deadly
  shrapnel, and the Razorjack, which shoots spinning blades that ricochet off
  walls. The secondary firing mode might allow a charged shot, sacrifice accuracy
  for speed, or even make it possible to guide the projectile.
  .
  The game also includes a multiplayer mode. Ten deathmatch maps are available for
  free-for-all, team deathmatch or a variant called "King of the Hill". A special
  mode is DarkMatch, for which one special map is available. In DarkMatch, the map
  is without any illumination, and players must use a searchlight to see anything.
  The deathmatch modes can be played against bots, and the game also offers a
  cooperative version of the single player campaign.
  .
  Unreal introduced the game engine of the same name, which employs such tricks as
  colored lighting, curved surfaces, reflective surfaces, "detail" textures (via
  multi-texturing), and real time interactive mixed digital music.
  .
  Gold version includes the original Unreal game and its expansion - Return to Na
  Pali.

  Unreal Tournament is the original King of the Hill in the frag-or-be-fragged
  multiplayer gaming world. As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal
  Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its
  pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics, brutal
  edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that gave
  gamers more than they ever expected.
  .
  Novice Mode - This Botmatch competition is where new flak fodder hit boot camp.
  The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots in the game move slower
  and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those new to first person
  shooters, this is where teeth are cut, skills are born and addiction begins...
  .
  Hardcore Mode - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse
  pad to wipe away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the
  bots move like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage
  with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts.
  .
  Enhanced Bot AI - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a
  big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually
  perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability
  to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real.
  .
  Radio Chatter - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied
  by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for
  cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs.
  Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents'
  messages too (even if you're playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too).
  .
  New Command Line Options - For the hardcore server masters, this is the dream
  way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak
  can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy!
  .
  Improved User Interface - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what
  is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each
  game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Assault), the game
  provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player
  with excessive info.
  .
  UBrowser - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way
  to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the
  need to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as
  one-two-frag. By clicking on the "Play Online" button and then selecting a
  server from the list, the game is on.
  .
  Spectator Cams - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be
  almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter
  a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the
  level. Even cooler, the camera can be "attached" to one of the players in the
  level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature
  and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming.
  .
  Jump Mode - Jump twice as high as normal. It's sorta' like having a never-ending
  pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost
  indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.

  And so Christof agrees to help the Brujah, getting involved in a complex net of
  intrigues and struggle between vampire clans, a struggle that will eventually
  take him to modern times, to London and New York, where his fate will finally be
  decided.
  .
  Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption is based on the pen-and-paper role-playing
  game Vampire: The Masquerade. Much of the game is dedicated to exploring hostile
  locations, fighting enemies (mostly other vampires) to complete missions and
  advance the storyline. Gaining experience points, the player develops Christof
  and other characters by increasing their statistics (such as Strength,
  Intelligence, Manipulation etc.) or learning and improving various disciplines,
  the magic spells of the game. Disciplines require blood, which can be restored
  with items or by feeding on enemies.
  .
  Combat is action-oriented. The player can directly control only one member of
  the party ("coterie"); the rest are controlled by AI. It is possible to switch
  between different characters at any time. Following the ethical code of the RPG,
  there is a Humanity bar for Christof, which can be reduces if the player decides
  to kill innocents or make evil decisions in the game. The game has several
  different endings that depend on the protagonist's Humanity level. There is also
  a multiplayer option.

developer: The Astronauts

description:
  The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that
  focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or
  explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won't be able
  to see them.
  .
  You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a
  disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul
  arrives at Ethan's home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even
  worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which
  Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into.
  .
  Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early
  twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve
  immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite
  a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially
  puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity
  of our characters.
  .
  Still, the discoveries won't happen on their own, or without your help. Using
  both Paul's supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and
  your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of
  corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the
  fate of a missing boy.

genre: Action;Construction and Management Simulation;Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  War for the Overworld is a spiritual successor to Bullfrog's Dungeon Keeper
  series from the nineties. The concept is largely similar as it is a blend of
  real-time strategy, god game, first-person action and role-playing in a fantasy
  setting. You are an Underlord, an evil etheral lord of the Underworld. After a
  long exile in the void you wake up in a world where the Empire (the 'Good Guys')
  is ruling, while the Underlords are fighting each other in the Underworld.
  .
  You have to restore your realm and your powers and build new dungeons for your
  minions, while resisting the Empire's forces. As an ethereal power, you cannot
  physically act in the real world. Your ethereal hand can trace zones to dig or
  to build rooms, cast spells, or seize units to drag them in a specific room. You
  need gold to build rooms or to pay your creatures and if you do not produce
  food, they will starve and revolt.
  .
  Each room attracts a different type of creature and allows for further
  development of the dungeon. Barracks train creatures, a library allows for
  research with new rooms, spells, traps ..., a foundry lets you build defences
  and so on.
  .
  The game contains a solo campaign of ten scenarios, two solo sandbox maps, three
  solo scenario maps and 36 solo/multiplayer skirmish maps. Multiplayer is
  supported both through local LAN and online.

developer: inXile Entertainment

genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  Wasteland 2 is the sequel to the 1988 title Wasteland. The game lets the player
  take control of a squad of rangers, in an attempt to explore the surrounding
  world, solve quests and defeat enemies.
  .
  Just like the original game it is a post-apocalyptic turn and party based RPG
  with tactical combat. The action takes place fifteen years after the end of the
  first Wasteland, kicking off with the player being tasked with finding out what
  happened to an experienced ranger who died in mysterious circumstances.
  Throughout the story, the player encounters enemies, quests, and different
  puzzles. The game lets players choose their own way to approach any situation
  they encounter, with skills, items and quests having an important impact on the
  surrounding world.
  .
  The party can consist of seven characters, up to four designed by the player
  with specific statistics, skills, opinions and traits, and three or more NPCs.
  The game puts a large emphasis on choice and consequence permanently affecting
  the characters and the game world.
  .
  Wasteland 2: Director's Cut is an enhanced version of Wasteland 2. For Xbox One
  and PS4 it is the first version of the game. For PC it is provided as a digital
  download for free to owners of the original version and it can also be bought
  separately. For GOG and Steam it does not replace the default version and it is
  available separately. Save files cannot be transferred.
  .
  The graphics have been overhauled and the game engine has been updated to Unity
  5. Improvements affect character models and environment art. There are also new
  visual effects for fire and explosions. Through Unity 5's physically-based
  rendering system, there are more realistic lighting conditions. The voice-overs
  are expanded with new voices. For the game mechanics a precision strike system
  is added to target individual body parts (head, torso, arms, legs) with negative
  status effects, similar to V.A.T.S. in Fallout games. There is a new perk system
  where a perk point is provided for every four character levels. The available
  perks depend on the character's skills. During character generation a quirk can
  be chosen, a specific personality trait that is permanent. There is rebalanced
  gameplay for weapon statistics, container locations, content scenes, merchant
  inventories, loot drops and more.
  .
  Changes during combat for enemy placement, numbers and cover positions have been
  implemented as well. There are new weapons in the game, found in hidden
  containers or carried by NPCs. The armour system is updated to make heavy armour
  conductive. This mainly affects the use of energy weapons as they do bonus
  damage against conductive armour and less damage against normal targets, instead
  of scaling the armour value. Along with the console release there is controller
  support for the PC versions.

  An old-school challenge in a crisp and colorful package, Wizardry: Labyrinth of
  Lost Souls revitalizes the time-honored formula of the original dungeon crawler
  series with modernized visuals and sound.
  .
  Choose each of your six team members' class, race, gender, and moral alignment,
  then delve into one of several dungeons near the central town hub. Advance with
  caution — monsters are vicious, deadly, and attack in packs. Plan each
  expedition carefully, stay focused on your objectives, and know when to retreat
  to the surface.
  .
  In between expeditions, chat with the locals, pick up new quests, pray for
  guidance at the temple, go bargain-hunting for new/rare equipment, and more.
  With patience, skill, and careful planning, your party will rise from a gang of
  paupers to a mighty force.\n
  The magic torches are lit, the monsters are ravenous, and the kingdom is waiting
  for a new hero. Enter the world of Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls and
  experience a classic adventure reborn.
  .
  KEY FEATURES\n
  Your Party, Your Way\n
  Choose from eight classes and five races to build a six-person team with diverse
  but complimentary skill sets. Change their classes in mid-adventure to fit your
  needs, or focus on leveling up their primary class to earn bonus skills for the
  party's benefit.
  .
  So Beautiful and So Dangerous\n
  Tangle with a menagerie of over 100 distinctive monsters, from the traditional
  to the bizarre, all drawn by famed series illustrator Jun Suemi. The game also
  features character illustrations by renowned commercial artist Yuki Hayabusa.
  .
  Conquer the Dungeons\n
  Every step through the underworld is fraught with danger, and one wrong move can
  end your adventure. But if you have the grit to withstand what the dungeons
  throw at you, both you and your party will gain enough experience to stroll
  through them like you own them.
  .
  Wizardry's Rebirth on PC\n
  The PC remaster of this classic originally released for PlayStation 3 features
  English and Japanese text with the original Japanese voiceovers, high-resolution
  graphics, and a brand new Turbo Mode to make exploring the game's massive
  dungeons a breeze. All story DLC is included, and players can download the
  Growth Fruit DLC for free to give themselves a boost when creating characters.

  The player controls a party of between two and six people from numerous fantasy
  backgrounds, identical to those found in Wizardry VII: the Human, Elf, Dwarf,
  Gnome, Hobbit, Faerie, Lizardman, Dracon (a half-Human, half-Dragon), Rawulf
  (anthropomorphic dogs), Felpurr (anthropomorphic cats) and Mook (aliens that
  resemble Sasquatch, or the Wookiees from Star Wars). They have come upon a
  castle that has been abandoned for over a hundred years, and which is rumored to
  contain the Cosmic Forge, a pen said to control the destiny of time and space.
  It is said that whatever is written with the pen becomes instantly true.
  Additionally, nobody knows what became of the King, Queen and Wizard who once
  lived there. Once the party enters the gates of the castle, the gates close
  behind them, making escape impossible.

developer: Sir-tech Software, Inc.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Wizardry 8 is the eighth and final title in the Wizardry series of role-playing
  video games by Sir-Tech Canada. It is the third in the Dark Savant trilogy,
  which includes Wizardry VI: Bane of the Cosmic Forge and Wizardry VII: Crusaders
  of the Dark Savant. It was published in 2001 by Sir-Tech, and re-released by
  Night Dive Studios on GOG.com and Steam in 2013.
  .
  Wizardry 8 is a direct sequel to Crusaders of the Dark Savant, the previous
  installment of the Wizardry series. All hell breaks loose as The Dark Savant
  takes flight with a device called the Astral Dominae, an incredibly powerful
  artifact containing the secret of life itself. Following him are two powerful
  races, the T'Rang and the Umpani, as well as the player's own brave party of
  adventurers. Everyone is heading to Dominus, a world on the cusp of the Cosmic
  Circle, birthplace of the Astral Dominae and home of the Cosmic Lords. Many
  paths will converge on Dominus, and many long-hidden secrets will be revealed.
  .
  The basic gameplay system is similar to the previous entries in the series: the
  player-controlled party of up to six characters roams the world viewed from a
  first-person perspective, completes quests and fights enemies to gain experience
  and become stronger. Unlike those, however, Wizardry 8 has a real 3D
  environment, where enemies visibly approach the party (rather than appearing
  randomly). The party is also able to move during combat, sometimes using terrain
  to its advantage. Character formation plays a role, the player being able to use
  tactical setups for the party in order to be better prepared for upcoming
  fights. Though still turn-based, the battles are more flowing than in the
  earlier games, since the characters act depending on their personal statistics
  rather than being confined by rounds.
  .
  The eleven races from the two previous games return, encompassing traditional
  fantasy RPG representatives such as elves and dwarves, as well as the more
  exotic rawulfs, felpurrs and mooks. A new character class, the Gadgeteer, has
  been added to the other fourteen imported from the previous games. The player
  can customize the statistics of these characters as he sees fit during the party
  creation phase. It is also possible to add personality traits to each of the
  characters. These do not affect the gameplay, but provide commentaries from the
  party members during conversations with the NPCs. A skill system is used for all
  the character types, ranging from weapon and magical proficiencies to
  pickpocketing and communication. Skills, as well as main attributes, can be
  manually developed by the player when the character levels up, but they also
  increase with repeated use.
  .
  Similarly to its predecessor, Wizardry 8 has several beginnings depending
  whether the player has imported a party from Crusaders of the Dark Savant or
  not, and which faction that party was allied with in the previous game. The game
  also has three different endings, which are achieved by making choices before
  the final confrontation.

  Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is an action-adventure first-person shooter video
  game developed by MachineGames and published by Bethesda Softworks. It was
  released on May 5, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The
  game is a stand-alone expansion pack in the Wolfenstein series, and a prequel to
  2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order. Set in an alternate history 1946, the single-
  player story follows war veteran William "B.J." Blazkowicz and his efforts to
  discover the locations of a Nazi compound. Development began in 2014, soon after
  the release of The New Order.
  .
  The game is played from a first-person perspective and its levels are navigated
  on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to
  progress through the story. It is separated into two interconnected campaigns.
  The game features a variety of weapons, including pistols, shotguns, and
  explosives, most of which can be dual wielded. A cover system is also present;
  players lean in and out of cover instead of the more common system where players
  lock into cover.
  .
  Wolfenstein: The Old Blood was met with a generally positive reception upon
  release. Many critics praised the game's intense firefights, intriguing
  locations, and the balance between stealth and action. Many critics disliked the
  game's story however, with most reviewers saying it was the weakest part of the
  game, and that it is a step back compared to The New Order's story, which was
  heavily complimented.

  Prepare yourself for the most thrilling night of your life! Something strange
  has happened and people everywhere are turning into blood thirsty walking
  corpses. But guess who's the brains behind this hungry undead army? YOU! So
  spread this pandemic to wipe humanity off this planet. Because the only way to
  survive the zombie apocalypse, is to BE the apocalypse!
  .
  But the brainless undead are quite dumb... even dumber than you might expect given
  their lack of grey matter. Because when left to their own devises, they will
  just endlessly walk forward and fall into permanently deadly booby traps placed
  by not-so-helpless humans. So to accomplish your mission of world extermination,
  you will need to help guide them to their next yummy meal. Luckily you can
  utilize numerous special mutations to make your troops evolve and fulfil their
  appetite for flesh. But beware! Humans will not facilitate your dark will....they
  will fight to survive.
  .
  Spread terror through 50 levels and enrol more zombies into your undead army.
  Along the way you'll have to solve brain tingling puzzles, and fight
  increasingly powerful foes that are hell-bent on staying alive. The closer you
  get to total world extinction, the harder survivors will fight to put you in the
  ground....for good.
  .
  Blood, tears, non-sexual moans, inappropriate laughter, and tons of puzzles that
  will literally blow your brains out... This is Zombie Night Terror!
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  - Command a Zombie Horde: You are the brain, they are the muscles. Your zombie
  horde will obey your commands without any strike risk or complaints ... On the
  downside; you can't have any heated conversations about late night movies or
  cool books anymore tough!\n
  - Unique Mutation System: Having an army of deadly zombies is awesome. Having an
  army of mutated zombies is way better! Take advantage of our mutation system to
  overcome the enemy's defences, by creating powerful new zombie types. Each has
  their unique power and abilities that can help you overcome different
  situations.\n
  - Combo System: Because you thought mutations were your only way to facilitate
  your meat feast, we spiced it up allowing you to combine those and see what your
  enemies are made of (literally). Let's show those pesky humans how to have
  fun!\n
  - Level Editor With Full Steam Workshop Support: Ever wanted to create your very
  own devious Zombie Apocalypse? Then we do have something for you! The Level
  Editor lets you design levels from scratch and share them with the community,
  using Steam Workshop. Start slow by crafting a single level, then crank things
  up with a full chapter loaded with enemies, traps, bonuses, mutations, and
  intellectually superior dialogue of your own choosing, all of which unfolds
  according to your devious plan.\n
  - You are not alone: Having zombies is kind of like having a pet; it's fun but
  you need to take care of them... That's what humans are for, as they are the
  perfect way to keep your zombies well fed and busy. But beware! Humans are well
  armed and they do not appreciate the toothy company of the undead.\n
  - Contaminate: Don't have enough company? Do you need a bigger horde? Well, just
  convert Humans to your cause then! You don't necessary need to bring flowers and
  be charming, as a single bite right into the neck (or anywhere that pleases you)
  should be enough to do the trick!\n
  - Destructible Environments: In times of a zombie apocalypse, humans love to
  take their time playing hide and seek. However when the hunger for tasty flesh
  is this painful, you don't have time for such childishness. So use the power or
  your horde to destroy their playground and spread terror among them... PEEKABOOM!
