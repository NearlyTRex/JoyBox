  Action 52 OWNS is a TIGSource unofficial collaboration created by Arthur Lee.
  The objective is for 52 developers to each select a game from the infamous
  Action 52 (the NES version) and make it enjoyable to play. Each TIGSource
  user had to declare their selection (with exception of The Cheetahmen, which
  was reserved for "someone who deserves it" which was originally granted to
  Konjak but he lost interest and dropped it, and ate an apple'. It was then
  bequeathed to increpare but he also dropped it. Currently not worked on by
  anyone). When all the games are remade they will made into a Windows arcade
  package called Action 52 OWNS, which will act as a compilation and launcher.

game: Aliens Versus Predator Gold (USA)

developer: Rebellion
publisher: Fox Interactive
genre: Action;Horror;Shooter
description:
  Aliens Versus Predator is a sci-fi first-person shooter based on the associated
  two film franchises. The game has three playable species, and each has its own
  single-player campaign with different missions and plotlines.
  .
  - Aliens... Their only weapons are their own body parts: claws for close combat,
  their deadly tail, and their inner mouth that can crack through an enemy's skull
  (for an instant kill) if close enough. They are deadly at close range, and can
  heal by eating corpses or the heads of unsuspecting enemies. They can't be hurt
  through falls, and an alternate vision mode allows them to see clearly ahead
  through darkness. Their strength lies in flexibility and speed, and an ability
  to cling to walls and run along any surface - allowing a skilled player to
  escape or ambush from literally any 3D direction.
  .
  - Humans... U.S. Marines, as portrayed by Michael Biehn in the film 'Aliens'.
  Marines have strong firepower that ranges from the self-tracking SmartGun, all
  the way to rocket launchers and devistating six-barrel miniguns (as seen in
  'Predator'). The Marines are the most familiar species to play as, with the
  gameplay style of typical FPS hero. However, their frailty at close range, and
  missions that leave them stranded, alone, surrounded by bloodthirsty
  extraterrestrials, make their experience closer to survival horror.
  .
  - Predators... Their power is their strength, and their sight. They have at
  least four ways of seeing the environment - standard vision, heat vision
  (highlighting Marines), electromagnetic vision (highlighting Aliens), and
  "Pred-Tech" (for highlighting fellow Predators and their technology). Their
  weapons are the most precise, deadly, and ranged of those in the game, being
  ideally suited to stealth-based gameplay. Predators also have the ability to
  zoom their view in and out when seeking someone, thus allowing them to snipe
  from afar. Their cloaking ability also renders them nearly invisible to enemy
  Marines.
  .
  There are several multiplayer modes. For a difficult game, you can pit all the
  players against the horde of computer creatures (which includes experimental
  robotic Aliens and tough Predalien hybrids). Alternatively, players can choose
  their favorite species and face each other in an arena-style deathmatch.
  .
  Aliens Versus Predator: Gold Edition is a compilation with the following
  content:
  .
  - Aliens Versus Predator\n
  - Aliens Versus Predator: Millennium Expansion Pack\n
  - A strategy guide
  .
  Parts of the game were also reworked for this edition.

developer: Frictional Games
publisher: Frictional Games
genre: Action;Adventure;Horror
description:
  In Amnesia: The Dark Descent, the player takes on the role of Daniel, an
  amnesiac man trapped in the mansion of a Prussian Baron named Alexander. The
  only clues to Daniel's true identity are mementos and notes left behind by
  Daniel himself, who reminds himself to find and kill Alexander. Gameplay has the
  player searching for Daniel's diaries and other notes and journals of the poor
  souls who have crossed Baron Alexander. The player must solve the mystery of the
  mansion while running from a Shadow that is constantly chasing the player
  throughout the game.
  .
  The game takes place from a first person perspective, however there are no
  weapons. Daniel cannot fight monsters and the only choice is to run or hide.
  Along with self-preservation, the players must keep the hero sane. In order to
  stay sane, he must keep moving and pushing the plot forward, as well as making
  sure there is always light. It is often necessary to scour every corner for oil
  and tinderboxes. Oil will allow Daniel to use a lamp to provide him with light
  and tinderboxes can be used to light candles and torches strewn throughout the
  mansion. If Daniel remains in the dark for too long, he will gradually lose his
  sanity. As Daniel loses sanity, the world will distort and become hard to
  navigate and the monsters will be able to sense the player. The player must
  evade the monsters entirely, but this will affect Daniel's sanity as to hide
  from the monsters, the player must also hide in the dark. The player must also
  never look at the monsters because if Daniel stares at them too long, his sanity
  will be fully compromised.
  .
  The player must solve various puzzles and the game is very much a fully
  interactive adventure game. Interaction with the environment is performed by
  using a physics based method where the mouse is emulated as a hand, meaning the
  player will need to rotate it to turn wheels or use it to grab drawers and pull
  them open by moving the mouse. It is also possible to pick up objects and throw
  them to distract the shadow or solve certain physical puzzles.

game: Apotheon (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Disc/A/Apotheon (USA)/Apotheon (USA).json
developer: Alientrap
publisher: Alientrap
genre: Action;Adventure;Platform
description:
  Apotheon is a 2D side-scrolling action game with puzzle elements and a visual
  design based on the Black Figure style of Ancient Greek pottery. The game is set
  in a world based on Ancient Greek mythology. The gods have abandoned the world
  and now the sea is without fish, the forest without trees and the earth without
  sun. Mankind has fallen prey to war to survive. The player controls the young
  warrior Nikandreos who fights the Olympian gods with the help of Hera.
  .
  Nikandreos needs to fight enemies and solve environment based puzzles to
  progress. He can pick up new weapons in the environment and many parts are
  destructible, providing new weapons that can be cycled through quickly, health,
  armour and coins. Coins can be spent to acquire better equipment. Weapons
  include swords, spears, bows, knives, javelins, stones, axes, hammers,
  slingshots, fire bombs and explosive traps. In later parts of the game different
  abilities of weapons often need to be used quickly in succession. For most of
  the weapons there are improved versions that can be located with additional
  abilities.
  .
  The level path is not linear and it is possible to explore in different
  directions, akin to an open world where Olympus acts as a central hub. Through a
  map different types of objectives are presented and these can generally be
  tackled in any order. The main quest consists of completing several domains, one
  for each god, split up in multiple smaller levels. Information about the
  different gods and their motives is often provided through stone steles. There
  are often side quests and optional objectives. The domains for the different
  gods include Apollo, Ares, Artemis, Athena, Hades, Poseidon and Zeus while the
  main locations are the Acropolis, the Agora market and the Olympian Gate. There
  is no experience system to level up, but a steady increase of weapons
  proficiency and armour strength through purchases.
  .
  The game has three difficulty settings and supports local one-on-one multiplayer
  where two players fight duels in small environments.

game: Armello (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Disc/A/Armello (USA)/Armello (USA).json
developer: League of Geeks
publisher: League of Geeks
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy;Board Game
description:
  Armello is a board game like fantasy strategy game with animals as your main
  protagonists. As the king of Armello is slowly getting insane due to a plague
  called "The Rot", the four races he once united will try to claim the throne for
  themselves. You will be one of the contestants of the four playable races, with
  each race providing a male and a female character: wolves, rabbits, rats and
  bears.
  .
  There are four ways to win the game:
  .
  - Kill the king in battle (King Slayer Victory)\n
  - Heal the king with four Spirit Stones (Spirit Stone Victory)\n
  - Kill the king with a rot value higher than the kings (Rot Victory)\n
  - If the king dies from it's illness or when both the king and and eventual
  attacker die, the player with the most prestige points wins (Prestige Victory)
  .
  You will move your character around the hexagonally tiled lands of Armello and
  accept quests, attack other players / enemies or search dungeons to gain points
  in one of several categories: attack, body, wits, spirit, gold, magic, prestige
  and rot. Prestige is worth a closer look, as it is not only necessary for the
  Prestige Victory, but the player with the highest prestige will also be able to
  choose from two "King's Declarations" that will affect all players each day.\n
  Additionally at the beginning of your turn you can stock up your card deck
  (depending on your wits value). The cards may contain equipment, one time
  bonuses or cards to harm another player's progress (like putting a "Peril" on a
  field your opponent will likely visit next turn or lower the income of one of
  his villages). Fights and perils will be decided by rolling dice (where their
  number depends on your points in the required category), but you may also "burn"
  some of your cards to get guaranteed results or use / equip them for bonuses.
  .
  The game is turn-based, with each player usually having 3 action points to
  spend. You cannot die permanently in the game, but in addition to being reset to
  your own clan's territory you will loose prestige and all remaining action
  points when doing so.
  .
  Apart from four short tutorial missions the game does not contain any campaign,
  but is focused on the board game aspect of the game including multiplayer
  support.

  The Great B-Ball Purge of 2041, a day so painful to some that it is referred

  ballers were massacred in a swath of violence and sports bigotry as the game

description:
  The second installment of the game is based on a story that was related briefly
  in the first game and the original movie. It is the tale of a Union soldier
  during the American Civil War, Lieutenant Robert MacNichol, who is mortally
  wounded in battle and left for dead. As he slips into unconsciousness, he hears
  a mysterious voice say, "Your time is not up yet, soldier. I have need of you
  yet!". Sure enough, his time is not up â€“ a young girl called Robin Weaver finds
  him and helps him back to the isolated house where she lives with her
  grandmother, Bess.
  .
  While he heals, MacNichol has a number of hallucinations and a near-death
  experience, in which he learns, but does not fully comprehend, that Robin is in
  danger. When he awakes, it is discovered that he is suffering from amnesia, and
  cannot remember who he is. The only clue to his past is the uniform he wears.
  Since MacNichol cannot remember his name, Robin's grandmother, a devout
  Christian, temporarily names him Lazarus.
  .
  Robin's grandmother, with Lazarus now in her debt, informs him that Robin has
  disappeared into the woods and begs him to find her. She is convinced that "the
  woods have her." Lazarus regards this as paranoia, and thinks that Robin has
  simply gone to play in the woods and is late in returning. Bess is insistent,
  however, and the soldier reluctantly agrees to help in the search for Robin.
  .
  As the game progresses, Lazarus recalls elements of his past, by means of
  flashback game sequences, which slowly explain how the current events come to
  be; MacNichol led his men into the forest in search of confederate scavengers,
  who all fell prey to the curse before MacNichol was shot in the head. He
  discovers a blind old hermit to be Robin's abductor, for a sacrifice for the
  demon Hecaitomix. The hermit made a deal with Hecaitomix to get his eye sight
  restored, and Hecaitomix turns him into a demon himself. MacNichol learns of a
  ritual that Hecaitomix and is using in a plot to possess Robin, involving
  imprisoning children's souls and mutilating the search party.
  .
  MacNichol manages to disrupt the ritual, allowing Hecaitomix to temporarily
  possess him, while he sends Robin back to her grandmother. Using the last of his
  strength, MacNichol manages to free the imprisoned souls, and defeat
  Hecaitomix's acolyte. MacNichol collapses into unconsciousness, but awakes
  confused back in the Weaver house.

description:
  The final episode of the trilogy is an original story that was not mentioned in
  the film, although it was briefly referred to in the first two games. It is
  basically an origin story, telling of how the Blair Witch legend came to be, set
  in 1785, in the early days of the Blair Township (later renamed Burkittsville).
  The story's main character is Jonathan Prye, a former priest who left the clergy
  during a crisis of faith. Prye, now a witch-hunter, is called to Blair to
  investigate events related to the disappearance of a woman called Elly Kedward a
  few weeks earlier.
  .
  Elly Kedward was accused of witchcraft after it was found she had been drawing
  blood from the local children and performing pagan rituals. She was tried,
  convicted and sentenced to be banished from the town. Instead, the locals tied
  her to a wheelbarrow, dragged her into the nearby woods and left her to freeze
  to death. Kedward disappeared from the wheelbarrow to which she was tied, and
  was never seen again.
  .
  A few days later, children from the township began to disappear, and the
  terrified villagers began to flee â€” with only the local magistrate, Jonah, and
  the township's chaplain, Father Hale Goodfellow, remaining behind. Father
  Goodfellow is convinced that a supernatural force is at work; Jonah, a skeptic,
  refuses to believe this, assuming Kedward is behind the kidnappings and is still
  at large near the town. There are also two people who are locked in a jail in
  the town: Hirrum Heathtow is a drunk, and Elizabeth Styler is a supposed witch
  who was arrested when she was found in Elly's house, reciting strange phrases.
  .
  The player must guide Prye through his investigation, to discover what happened
  to Elly Kedward. In his search, he happens upon a child having been bound and
  tortured in the forest. After freeing the child, a voice warns him not to
  interfere before sending zombies onto him. In the forest, Prye meets a shaman by
  the name of Asgaya Gigagei, who tells him of the legend of Hecaitomix, an evil
  spirit once worshipped by the Natives before white settlers first arrived.
  Angered that he's no longer revered, Hecaitmox plans to destroy the human race
  and conquer the world. Prye learns that Hecaitomix has abducted a number of
  children for sacrificial murder, and makes it his quest to rescue them.
  .
  Prye's journey not only takes him throughout the woods, but into the spirit
  realm which Hecaitmox conquered, but the demonic realm which he already rules.
  While rescuing Hecaitomix's hostages and facing his minions, Prye eventually
  faces Hecatomix himself, with Asgaya's help. After escaping Hecaitomix's realm,
  Prye encounters Styler, who reveals herself to be a servant and vessel of
  Hecaitomix. The two fight, with Prye managing to defeat her (either by killing
  her or exorcising the demon from her body).
  .
  If Styler is killed, Prye is thanked by the townspeople for having rescued the
  children and is offered a job as a constable, which Prye declines, having
  regained his faith and returns to his church to resume his previous position.
  Exorcising Styler results in a different ending where she returns to her senses
  and thanks Prye, explaining that she had been under the demon's influence all
  throughout the story. She asks Prye to come with her, hinting at a romantic
  partnership. Prye declines, reaffirming his faith and desire to return to his
  flock. Prye and Styler share a goodbye and part ways.

  Brutal Doom is a gameplay mod that was created in 2010 by Sergeant Mark IV.
  It is compatible with Doom, The Ultimate Doom, Doom II: Hell on Earth,
  Final Doom, TNT: Evilution, Plutonia and other custom WADs. Brutal Doom
  won the first ever Cacoward in 2011 for Best Gameplay Mod and a MOTY
  award for creativity by Mod DB in 2012.
  .
  Brutal Doom received public recognition from John Romero himself during
  the IGN gameplay video made for the 20th anniversary of Doom, stating that
  if they had released Brutal Doom instead of Doom back in 1993, they
  "would've destroyed the game industry" and that "Brutal Doom is hilarious"
  (said at 1:08:48).
  .
  Perhaps the most obvious and eye-catching feature of Brutal Doom is the
  addition of features like; additional blood (blood is splattered on
  walls and ceilings if enemies or the player are hit), the ability to
  blow off body parts with strong weapons like the shotgun and the
  addition of special illuminating effects on projectiles and pick ups.
  It is compatible with the source ports ZDoom, GZDoom, Skulltag, and
  Zandronum.
  .
  While primarily a gore mod, it goes further and alters the game-play by
  changing many other aspects such as the sounds, graphics, and combat.
  One major change is the increased difficulty; making enemy behavior much
  faster, unpredictable and dangerous (many attacks do double the normal
  damage to the player) and altering their attacks. It also makes the
  animations smoother and gives the player new abilities.

  Detective Jack Walters arrived in Innsmouth to solve a case of a missing person.
  But soon he finds himself confronted with terrible mysteries older than
  humanity, and with ghosts of the mysterious events that led to his incarceration
  in a mental hospital years ago.
  .
  Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a first-person action-adventure
  survival horror game, based on the H.P. Lovecraft mythos and his short story
  "The Shadow Over Innsmouth".
  .
  Initially, CoC: DCotE plays like an adventure game, but soon it gains elements
  of a stealth game and of a first-person shooter. Notably, the game does not
  feature an on-screen HUD (not even a crosshair); Jack's health is hinted at by
  visual cues; as for ammo, you need to remember how much you have left before
  you'll have to reload.
  .
  The health system used in the game is uncommon. There is no "hit points" system;
  rather, Jack receives minor or major wounds in specific parts of the body, and
  if he breaks a leg he's slowed down. To heal himself and prevent death from
  bleeding out, Jack can pick up medikits which contain bandages, splints, sutures
  and antidotes, each of which is used to heal a specific type of wound. Ill
  effects emerging from the wounds can be temporarily suppressed with a fix of
  morphine.
  .
  Jack's sanity also plays an important role. When Jack looks at disturbing things
  or finds himself in alarming conditions, his vision blurs, he begins hearing
  voices and talking to himself. If this gets too bad, Jack may go insane or
  commit suicide. Also, Jack suffers from acrophobia, and looking down in high
  places will cause him vertigo.

genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  The story of Diablo II takes place some time after the end of the previous game,
  Diablo, in the lands of Sanctuary. In Diablo the main body of the story takes
  place beneath the floors of a cathedral in a small town known as Tristram. It is
  here that Diablo, the Lord of Terror, is defeated by an unnamed warrior after
  many previous battles are also won.\n
  The unnamed warrior that vanquished Diablo drove the demon's soulstone into his
  forehead, in an attempt to contain the monster's essence within his own body.
  Later in the canon it is suggested that this is what Diablo intended so that,
  should he be defeated, he had an "escape plan" in place of dying.\n
  The unnamed warrior is ill fated from the moment he does this and is gradually
  corrupted over the course of the next few days by the demon's spirit. Deckard
  Cain recounts the story to the next band of adventurers that pass through the
  Rogue Encampment in Diablo II. It is one of these adventurers that appears in
  the wake of the destruction caused by the now possessed unnamed warrior, and
  attempts to find out the cause of the evil, starting with the corrupted warrior
  (known as the Dark Wanderer throughout Diablo II).

description:
  A group of scientists discovers an asteroid that is on its way to a collision
  with the Earth. Is there any way to prevent the disaster? Boston Low, a NASA
  veteran, is sent to command a space expedition on the asteroid. Accompanied by
  the journalist Maggie Robbins and the archaeologist Brink, Boston investigates
  the asteroid and finds a strange structure that undoubtedly belongs to an alien
  civilization. During the course of investigations, the team finds itself on a
  seemingly deserted planet. They have no knowledge of the planet and no
  possibility of going back. Will they ever discover the secret of this strange
  world and find a way to get home?
  .
  The Dig is a point-and-click adventure game with a simple one-cursor interface.
  Most of the puzzles are inventory-based, tending to be somewhat more complex
  than in most preceding LucasArts' adventure games. There are also a few
  logic-based puzzles, which require understanding and manipulation of alien
  technology and life forms on the planet. Traditional branching dialogue system
  is utilized; however, the game focuses more on puzzle-solving than on
  conversations to advance the plot.
  .
  The game's story is influenced by science fiction literature and movies, and
  strives to be realistic, departing from the comedy style of LucasArts'
  adventures. Despite that, humorous elements are present in some of the dialogues
  and text descriptions. The game utilizes hand-drawn graphics with a few
  pre-rendered 3D images.

developer: id Software, Inc.
publisher: GT Interactive Software
genre: Shooter
description:
  DOOM II: Hell on Earth is a first-person shooter video game, the second title of
  id Software's Doom franchise. It was originally released for MS-DOS computers in
  1994 and Macintosh computers in 1995. Unlike DOOM, which was initially only
  available through shareware and mail order, DOOM II was a commercial release
  sold in stores. Master Levels for DOOM II, an expansion pack that includes 21
  new levels, was released on December 26, 1995 by id Software.
  .
  DOOM II was not dramatically different from its predecessor. There were no major
  technological developments, graphical improvements, or substantial gameplay
  changes. Instead, the development team took advantage of advances in computer
  hardware since the release of the original game that allowed them to do more
  with their game engine by making much larger and more intricate levels. The game
  still consisted of the player navigating large non-linear levels. Each level is
  infested with demons that can be killed with a variety of weapons that can be
  picked up throughout the game. Levels are completed by finding an exit, whether
  it be a switch or a teleport, the goal is simply to advance to the next area. As
  with its predecessor, DOOM II's levels can be completed in a straightforward
  fashion. However, because the levels are non-linear players can wander off the
  beaten path, and those that do are often rewarded with bonuses, like health
  pickups and more powerful weapons. Due to the larger and more complicated maps
  with larger groups of monsters, the game had somewhat higher system requirements
  than the original.
  .
  Rather than the player playing through three related episodes as in the first
  DOOM, gameplay takes place over one giant episode, albeit with interludes for
  when the story develops. Instead of watching the player's progress on a map (as
  in the original episodes of DOOM), the screens between each level simply show a
  background (a style carried over to the bonus fourth episode of DOOM available
  in The Ultimate DOOM, the retail re-release of the original DOOM). This also
  means the player is never forced to lose all of his or her inventory after
  completing an episode.
  .
  DOOM II doubled the number of non-boss monster types and started using bosses
  from the original DOOM as normal level enemies, in addition to adding a new
  weapon, the double-barreled shotgun (called the Super Shotgun in the game), and
  a new power-up, the Megasphere.

  EV Override is Ambrosia's huge follow up to the classic Escape Velocity. With an

  strong sense of destiny. But the similarity ends there.

  Override features a universe five times the size of the original game, and a
  slew of populated worlds within. Gone are the neverending wars which raged in
  the original game; instead, winning critical battles can change the face of the
  universe. Or, if you're happy with the existing balance of power, you can make a

  nothing more than to swipe the precious cargo from your holds.

  A devastating nuclear war had wiped out almost the entire population of the
  Earth. The civilization, as we know it, has been destroyed. The Earth has become
  a huge wasteland populated by mutated creatures. Only small number of humans
  survived and they formed communities living on the surface, where they mostly
  scavenge what remains from the pre-war civilization. Some lucky people managed
  to reach safety of the Vaults, huge underground dwellings, during the war.
  Recently, the water purification controller chip in Vault 13 broke. Without
  clean water, the people of the Vault cannot survive. One person is sent to find
  a replacement chip and ventures outside to face a dangerous world, hoping to
  return within a hundred and fifty days.
  .
  Fallout is a role-playing game that utilizes a character development system
  called S.P.E.C.I.A.L., an acronym formed from the first letters of the game's
  basic character attributes: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma,
  Intelligence, Agility and Luck. In addition to having these attributes, the
  protagonist can also learn and improve skills, as well as acquire traits and
  perks.
  .
  Skill points are awarded when the player character levels up; traits are
  assigned during character creation, while perks are obtained every three
  character levels. There are eighteen different skills in the game, divided into
  combat, active, and passive categories. Combat skills include weapon
  proficiencies (e.g. small and big guns, melee, etc.); active skills are used for
  support or interacting with the environment (doctor, lockpick, science, steal,
  and others); passive skills are mainly dedicated to social interaction (barter,
  speech, gambling, and so on). Traits bestow various benefits upon the character
  while also imposing penalties; in contrast, perks are purely beneficial. By
  developing and customizing attributes, skills, traits and perks, the player is
  granted a considerable freedom in shaping the protagonist in his combat-related
  and social behavior.
  .
  The game has an open world which can be freely explored from the onset. Only a
  few quests are required to complete in order to advance the main plot; a vast
  amount of side quests is available. Thanks to the game's emphasis on social
  interaction, many problems can be solved in a non-violent way; in fact, it is
  possible to complete the game without engaging in battles at all, running away
  from enemy encounters and concluding the final confrontation in a relatively
  peaceful fashion. Conversely, the player can opt for a destructive path, killing
  everyone in sight. A Karma system is used to track the player's moral decisions
  during the game.
  .
  Combat in Fallout is turn-based. Participants have a limited amount of action
  points (AP) per turn; each action (including movement) depletes a certain number
  of AP, eventually ending a character's turn. The player can target specific body
  parts of enemies during battles. Characters may join the protagonist, traveling
  together and participating in combat as a party. Though the player

  The Forgotten Realms world of Dungeons & Dragons has been home to many a hero
  and imagination since its publication, producing adventures and stories to be retold
  and enjoyed for years to come. The Forgotten Realms Archive - Collection One allows
  you to journey through one such set of adventures: the Eye of the Beholder trilogy,
  a set of first-person, real-time role-playing games.
  .
  EYE OF THE BEHOLDER
  A new evil is plaguing the city of Waterdeep, stalking the streets and preying
  on its citizens. Though initially thought to come from afar, this great evil,
  known only as Xanathar, instead resides within Waterdeep and, if not stopped,
  threatens to overwhelm the city. The Lords of Waterdeep believe that the evil
  lurks in the sewers below and have commissioned a party of adventurers to
  investigate and foil this nefarious plot. Granted full rights of marque and
  ownership of any treasure, artifacts or valuables you find on your quest, you
  must venture into the chasms, discover the nature of this evil and destroy it
  by any means necessary.
  .
  EYE OF THE BEHOLDER II: THE LEGEND OF DARKMOON
  Following your quest in the sewers beneath, you and your party are recovering
  with Waterdeep's finest healers, when a letter arrives from Khelben Blackstaff,
  mystic advisor to the Lords of Waterdeep. Trouble is brewing in the Northern
  and Western regions, and he has tasked you with exploring the land and
  investigating these incidents. Although nothing has been confirmed, renowned
  but troublesome archaeologist, Wently Kelso believes the disturbances are
  related to an evil uprising and the presence of a powerful ancient artefact.
  These troubles could, of course, simply be the work of unruly bandits, but
  since Kelso's previous findings in the sewers of Waterdeep proved true, one
  would be wise not to easily dismiss his opinion on the matter. Therefore,
  you should exercise greater care and vigilance as you begin your next adventure.
  .
  EYE OF THE BEHOLDER III: ASSAULT ON MYTH DRANNOR
  Having rid the sewers of Waterdeep and the dreaded Temple Darkmoon of the evil
  forces within, you and your companions are surely deserving of a strong drink,
  good food and a warm fire. And so, your first port of call is to the nearest
  tavern, where you slop ale all over yourself and engage in jovial antics as
  you regale your adventures to your captivated listeners and admirers. However,
  in the midst of your retelling, the tavern door is thrust open by a hooded
  figure, whose eyes scan the crowd before locking on you and your party.
  Approaching you, he quickly introduces himself and explains his reasons for
  disturbing the festivities; his master wishes you to free the ruined city of
  Myth Drannor from the clutches of a Lich and restore it to its former glory.
  Looks like your adventures aren't over just yet
  .
  With an original story set in the Forgotten Realms universe, the Eye of the
  Beholder trilogy is based on the Advanced Dungeon & Dragons 2nd Edition's
  game rules. Bringing the immersion, wonder and epicness of a D&D campaign
  to the PC, the Eye of the Beholder is a genre-defining and beloved series
  for RPG and Dungeons & Dragons fans alike.

file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Disc/G/GameShark PC Code Browser CD-ROM for Game Boy (USA)/GameShark PC Code Browser CD-ROM for Game Boy (USA).json
developer: InterAct
publisher: InterAct
genre: Utility
description:
  Released in 1998 for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, it came preloaded with
  codes for 158 games. This list was revised with new games with each
  Gameshark version/revision, as well as the ability to add your own game
  folders and codes. Codes were saved as a string of HEX values that
  represented a specific game state or attribute at a specific memory location
  within the game ROM. When the Game Boy attempted to execute code at said
  memory address, the Game Shark would overwrite it with its own modified code
  (Cheat Code). This allowed for everything from invincibility, extra lives,
  unlimited ammo, rapid fire, sprite modifications, and much more.
  .
  With a feature called Snapshot, a player could take a ROM image of the current
  state of the attached Game Cartridge. The result was the ability to restore the
  game state to a single previous Snapshot, a precursor of sorts to save states
  more commonly enjoyed in modern ROM emulation software. With the V3.1 revision,
  Snapshots could also be saved or downloaded from the PC via an included cable
  that connected to the link-cable port on the Game Boy and a PC's
  Printer/Parallel Port. Game Cartridges that featured a save function utilized
  a battery backup in order to prevent volatile-RAM from losing power when the
  Game Boy was switched off. However, as these batteries ran dry, the ability
  to save game data became impossible. The Gameshark on the other hand utilized
  non-volatile memory that didn't require a battery backup. So Snapshots and
  game codes could be stored indefinitely. A Gameshark was known as a temporary
  workaround for saving games with a depleted battery backup. Gameshark PC
  Software allowed for the creation and management of codes on the PC, profiles,
  even Gameshark Menu wallpapers and themes when used with a Game Boy Color.
  There was also a message board where players could share codes and Game
  Snapshots with each other.

  Playing Frog Fractions 2:
  .
  Frog Fractions 2 has finally been found, and if youâ€™re looking to play, there
  are a couple of different options available.
  .
  The easiest way to get to Frog Fractions 2 is by using fireworks. According
  to Glitterman Groveâ€™s description, there are "special fribblesham fireworks"
  that can used to find buried treasure. If you take these fireworks and use
  them to dig through the ground, youâ€™ll come across a door. This is the
  quickest way to access the game.
  .
  There is, however, another door that leads to the game located in the sky.
  The only way to access the door is by actually playing Glittermitten Grove
  which, it should be noted, is a real game entirely separate from Frog
  Fractions 2 inside it. For those wondering, Glittermitten Grove allows
  players to "sow the fields with magic seeds, pick berries from the plentiful
  boughs of our sugar fern trees, and collect sparkles from the resplendent
  rays of our sun-kissed thicket to help us prepare for the long winter ahead."

developer: Fiddlesticks
publisher: Curve Digital
genre: Adventure;Platform;Puzzle
description:
  Hue is a puzzle game played as a side-scrolling platformer. The player controls
  the male character Hue who needs to find back his missing mother. She developed
  a ring called Annular Spectrum which allows perception and alteration of
  impossible colours, beyond the human spectrum. She was deceived by the
  traitorous professor Dr. Grey she fell in love with and has now become
  invisible, as a shade of such as impossible colour. It is up to Hue to restore
  the ring and bring her back by collecting the many scattered coloured shards.
  .
  The game consists of a large, 2D side-scrolling world where different
  environments are linked together through doors. The game uses a silhouetted art
  style which is initially monochromatic. Soon Hue discovers his first colour,
  which is added to a ring-like circle that can be summoned at any moment, as one
  of many bright colours. Eventually eight colours can be collected: aqua, blue,
  lime, orange, pink, purple, red and yellow. These are used for the main gameplay
  mechanic as the player can switch between them on the fly, even in the middle of
  actions as time is slowed down extensively during the selection. Changing a
  colour brings it into the environment, colouring almost anything. This mechanic
  is for instance used to discover hidden doors. Obstacles, barriers and other
  elements often have a specific colour and when Hue switches colours to match it,
  it disappears into the environment as if it was never there. The simple mechanic
  quickly becomes more complex due to moving elements, the ability to push and
  pull objects, platform-based puzzles, fast sequences and so on. While Hue can
  jump and there are some general elements such as ladders or deadly spikes,
  almost every area needs to be approached as a puzzle that can be solved without
  time pressure.
  .
  With each new discovered colour puzzles become more complex. There is also a
  minor metroidvania aspect to it as any area can be revisited, but mainly to open
  up passages leading to beakers as an optional collectible. Between puzzles the
  story is often furthered through envelopes which introduce sections with
  narration. The character can die, but respawns right away with no penalty and an
  endless amount of lives. The game has support for the colourblind, using symbols
  as a colour aid. In addition Razer Chroma, Corsair RGB plus many more coloured
  LED devices supported on Windows.

game: Lovely Planet (USA)

developer: QUICKTEQUILA
publisher: tinyBuild
genre: Action;Platform;Shooter
description:
  Lovely Planet is a first person platform shooter in a colorful world. Your goal:
  Reach the exit of the level by jumping through the world, shooting enemies and
  apples.
  .
  The game is split up intro 5 worlds, with each of them introducing some new
  gameplay element. The basic principle is always the same though: Whenever
  something happens that shouldn't have happened the level is reset. Reasons for
  the reset are (amongst others) when you touch or are being hit by an enemy, when
  you fall off the platforms or when one of those mentioned apples hits the
  ground. You are equipped with a simple gun with unlimited ammunition that can be
  used to shoot enemies and objects. The levels also contain several time critical
  situations, as entering certain areas will trigger events: for example catapults
  in the distance will throw the apples into the air or small knobs will generate
  a sphere that has to be left quickly.
  .
  In practice this feels a bit like trickjumping in games like the Quake series:
  You will have to run and jump through the level to reach that falling apple in
  time while at the same time shooting mandatory enemies and blocking obstacles.
  .
  Be warned however: The game's graphics and presentation are very cute and family
  friendly, but the gameplay is designed to be very challenging.

  The award-winning, genre-creating "indirect RTS" game Majesty is now available
  bundled with its expansion pack Majesty: The Northern Expansion.
  .
  Ever wonder what it would be like to sit on the throne of a growing fantasy
  kingdom? To enlist the aid of wizards, elves, barbarians, and other fantastic
  heroes in tackling epic fantasy's classic challenges? If you feel the lure of
  the crown, Majesty is for you.
  .
  Majesty is a unique sim putting you in the crushed-velvet hot seat of your own
  kingdom. With an epic quest before you, you make the decisions of where to build
  your settlement's guilds and temples. From these you recruit a varied cast of
  larger-than-life heroes. Each one has a mind of his own and must be enticed to
  meet your goals, via rewards you offer and spells you cast. Meanwhile you must
  make sure that your treasury stays flush with cash to support these and other
  outlays necessary to maintain a thriving medieval town. The fact that you are
  being barraged by attacks from mythical beasts and fantastic creatures doesn't
  make your job any easier. Poor choices will leave your kingdom in ruin, but a
  wise ruler will complete quests, fill the coffers, and create a kingdom that
  will be remembered in song and story.
  .
  The Northern Expansion (inlcuded in this Gold edition) is the expansion set for
  Majesty: The Fantasy Kingdom Sim. It will provide you with all new challenges
  for you and your heroes. There is more of everything that made Majesty great:
  new quests, buildings, monsters, lairs, spells, and art. The way is clear: the
  northern expanses await your rule.

  us got together with the goal of making a playable game out of it.

  The game was completed in february 2017, but is still ongoing. We expect
  to release further updates with more bug fixes, tweaks, as well as
  additional content like extra stages, more playable characters, and
  other cool stuff.

  There are mainly two things that set Mega Man 2.5D apart from most other
  Mega Man games. The first is the co-op mode, where two players team up
  to take on Dr. Wily. The other is the use of camera perspective changes
  which is featured a lot in the single-player mode of the game.

developer: Crunching Koalas
publisher: Crunching Koalas
genre: Puzzle
description:
  MouseCraft is a Lemmings-like puzzle game where you have to get at least one of
  three mice from the start to the target platform. The mice themselves will just
  move into one direction until they reach an obstacle, however they are able to
  climb over edges which are one block high. To modify the level you have a
  limited set of blocks resembling the well known Tetris blocks which can be
  placed before releasing the mice or during gameplay. The game may also be paused
  to place additional blocks or think about the next move.
  .
  The game's experiments are conducted by Dr. SchrÃ¶dinger, a cat scientist. To
  finance his experiments (i.e. reaching the later levels) the mice will have to
  collect crystals (called Anima Shards) spread around the levels. When
  progressing you will get additional block types like Jelly Bricks (making it
  possible for your mice to fall more than 3 blocks without dying) or crumbling
  bricks (which will dissolve after 2 mice walked over them). Once set most blocks
  cannot be moved any more, but may be erased by collecting bombs in the level.
  Blocks will fall down if they aren't held any more, which can also be used to
  block or kill robotic enemy mice called 'Ratoids'.
  .
  The game features 80 levels in four different laboratories as well as a level
  editor to create own levels.

genre: Action;Shooter;Shoot-'Em-Up;Top-Down
description:
  Nuclear Throne is an action roguelike game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland
  filled with mutants. The game was initially started as Wasteland Kings, a
  prototype created for the 2013 Mojam game jam. The developers then started work
  on a full version and took it to Steam's Early Access. Typical for the genre the
  game is meant to be played in multiple runs, with randomized environments, and
  weapon and monster placement for each session. It consists of several levels
  played in succession, each with a different theme, until the character gets a
  shot to claim the nuclear throne and become the new king. Many levels contain
  bosses with a brief introduction.
  .
  There is permadeath and up to twelve different playable characters can be
  unlocked, representing different playing styles. Next to the basic attack each
  character has a unique secondary action such as a roll or forming a shield,
  along with a general perk. The game is played as a twin-stick shooter where both
  movement and firing in any direction can be independently combined. Levels are
  short and always consist of a single, scrolling room. When all enemies are
  defeated a vortex appears that sucks the character into the next level. Levels
  contain random chests with weapons such as a revolver, machinegun, smart gun,
  minigun, shotgun, rifles, an incinerator, sluggers, bows, grenade launchers and
  bazookas, but also melee weapons such as a wrench or a screwdriver. Ranged
  weapons usually have a limited amount of ammo and require ammo pick-ups to keep
  using them. Up to two weapons can be carried and they can be swapped when a new
  one is encountered.
  .
  Enemies leave behind radioactive fragments known as rads. These can also be
  found as pick-ups. They fill a meter in the top left corner and when a
  sufficient amount has been collected the character levels up and a mutation is
  offered after completing a level. Mutations are perks permanent for that run and
  include a larger bullet capacity, less damage, more health, better range, better
  movement speed, slower enemy bullets, increased drops etc. The game supports
  cooperative offline games for up to two players. Next to the main game there are
  daily and weekly runs.

description:
  The idea behind Vlambeer's Nuclear Throne is simple: it's a post-apocalyptic
  roguelike-like top-down shooter. Not 'the final hope of humanity' post-
  apocalyptic, but 'humanity is extinct and weird mutants and terrifying monsters
  now roam the world' post-apocalyptic.
  .
  All you need to do is take control of one of those mutants and shoot the things
  trying to kill you. Use simple weaponry like quintuple-barreled bazookas, super
  plasma cannons or exquisite cursed laser miniguns. Or the game might just hand
  you a screwdriver. Deal with it.
  .
  Mutate some new limbs and abilities as you go, and become the ultimate Throne
  hunter. Find secret vaults with game-changing crowns, discover rare overpowered
  weaponry, or compete in the worldwide Daily and Weekly challenges. All these
  things and more you could do if only you were good at this game. Can you reach
  the Nuclear Throne?

description:
  Owlboy is described a 'hi-bit' game, a title with 16-bit-style visuals where you
  can fly and explore a world in the clouds. Owlboy needs to pick up friends and
  bring them along as he explores the open skies. He also needs to overcome
  obstacles and greater enemies.
  .
  The adventure starts in the village of Vellie, a close knit community carving
  out a living on the floating islands. Otus and his best friend Geddy are tasked
  with patrolling for sky pirates but they charge off to catch a bizarre laughing
  troublemaker. The duo stumble across a forgotten cave full of ancient owl
  mysteries. After the trail goes cold and the two head home, the village is
  swarmed with sky pirates. People are shaken up but it looks as if the pirates
  were preoccupied with something else and the capital city of Advent. Asio (the
  mentor of Otus) tasks the two to make haste and attempt a plan to stop the
  pirates.
  .
  You play as Otus, a mute owl who is thrust into the role of protecting his
  friends and family from pirates. He is unable to fight for himself so he relies
  on his friends ready to fight for him. Using an ancient and mysterious owl
  relic, gunners can teleport into the player's hands at an instance. Using the
  controller, the game plays similar to a twin-stick shooter. Otherwise control
  Otus with the keyboard and aim with the mouse.
  .
  Gameplay is reminiscent of classic franchises like Metroid, Zelda, Wonderboy,
  Kid Icarus, and Kirby. The game is both a love letter to classic games while
  being something new and modern due to the open exploration.

  Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins is the shareware version of Apogee's Rise of

  via the Scott Miller model, The HUNT Begins is a separate episode that serves as
  a prequel to the retail game. As Taradino Cassatt, member of the High-risk
  United Nations Taskforce (HUNT), the player must infiltrate the stronghold that
  El Oscuro's followers have established on a small island in the Gulf of Santa
  Catalina, and shut down their operations.

  As the shareware episode was meant to showcase the various features of the full
  game, some of the enemies and obstacles encountered in The HUNT Begins actually
  only make their first appearance in episodes two and three of the Dark War. That
  way, the shareware version allows to sample a substantial portion of the game's
  arsenal, enemy roster, items, traps and other obstacles.
  .
  The HUNT Begins contains a total of ten single-player levels (seven regular
  levels, one secret level and two "warp-only levels" which can be accessed only
  with the use of the level warp cheat), and additionally there are eight levels
  designed for online play. Three multi-player (Comm-Bat) modes are available in
  the shareware version: Normal, Score Mode, and Collector, and it is possible to
  play in these modes not only against the shareware version owners but also
  against opponents who have Dark War.

  said environment is highlighted as a "hot spot", and is also performed by simple

  SCP-087-B is an experimental first-person horror game created by Joonas
  "Regalis" Rikkonen, a man later known for developing SCP â€“ Containment Breach,
  based off the original SCP-087 game created by Haversine.

  The gameplay is extremely simple and linear, being an expansion of SCP-087,
  as it is about a random Foundation personnel (led by a doctor alerting them
  of enemies and how far they've gotten via radio) walking down a flight of
  stairs that range from 150 to 180 floor-wise. However, they are hunted down
  by a variety of monsters they must evade as they have no means of defense.
  These monsters include:
  .
  The Masked Man: A black humanoid donning a white mask who manifests itself
  in the darkness and will instantly kill the player upon contact.
  .
  The Red Mist Monster: Another black humanoid with glowing white eyes and red
  markings who acts similar to that of the Masked Man, but typically manifests
  itself in differing locations.
  .
  The Cheshire Smile: Simply being a disembodied twisted smile with piercing
  white eyes, the Cheshire Smile is completely harmless and randomly appears
  to frighten the player by whispering "No" and staring at them with its
  disturbing gaze.

developer: Valkyrie Studios
publisher: TopWare Interactive
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Septerra is a world which is composed of "layers" - continents that spin around
  the planet center. In the center is the Core, a kind of a living computer.
  According to the legends, the Creator of Septerra left there a precious Gift -
  an artifact that grants the one who possesses it legendary powers. Septerra is
  controlled by the Chosen, who live at the top of the world, consuming massive
  amounts of energy and throwing the "waste" down, to lower levels. Maya, a "junk
  scavenger" who lives among those wastes and earns the living collecting junk,
  unexpectedly comes into contact with the Chosen. It appears that their goal is
  to reach the legendary Gift. Maya and her friends decide to face the Chosen, and
  ultimately discover the true history of the planet.
  .
  Despite its Western origins, Septerra Core is a Japanese-style role-playing
  game. The game's visual design is close to Japanese anime, and the emphasis of
  the game is on a character-driven linear narrative with simple role-playing
  mechanics. The game's story evolves across the seven worlds of Septerra, each
  with its own distinct style, including post-apocalyptic, semi-medieval,
  futuristic, etc. In the first half of the game the player-controlled party
  explores these worlds on foot, accessing towns and other areas from an
  overworld. Later the player gains a ship that allows fast transportation to any
  world, including previously inaccessible areas.
  .
  Combat is turn-based and takes place against enemies who either visibly wander
  around or appear at pre-set locations in hostile areas. There are no enemies on
  the world map. The action bar of each character is divided into three segments
  and is gradually filled. Opting for either fast and weak or strong and slow
  attacks, the player must select a character in real time, stopping the bar and
  pausing combat. Magic spells are usually awarded after completing plot events
  and may be combined with each other by two or three characters to create new
  ones. The player is for the most part free to form a party of three active
  combatants from a larger cast.

  Comet and the resurgence of the Great Ancients who once dominated the land in a
  reign of terror? Legend tells tales of an ancient ritual ground, hidden deep in

  In Silent Hill 3 the player controls Heather, a simple teenage girl. One fine

  - and her own past - Heather must find a way to escape the dreadful town.
  .
  The third installment in the Silent Hill series is similar to its predecessor
  visually and gameplay-wise. Like the previous entries, it is a survival horror
  game combining action-based (predominantly close-ranged) combat and
  puzzle-solving. The game is somewhat more combat-oriented than the preceding
  installments. Heather is able to side-step and block some attacks, but in
  general shares with the other protagonists of the series their relative
  ineptitude in combat.

description:
  The Sims 2 is the official sequel to the "best-selling PC game of all-time", The
  Sims.
  .
  In this sequel, Maxis has created an entirely new, 3D engine, similar to the
  console Sim games. You can rotate the camera in a 360 view, or shuffle the
  camera to the left and right.
  .
  Your Sims are also fully animated, articulated characters. They have a wide
  range of movements, most of which are humorous. Eating, drinking, going to the
  bathroom, getting kissed, proposing marriage... everything has a specific
  animation to it.
  .
  The Sims 2 has an expanded Build mode. You can now create large houses, going up
  to four floors, with new types of wallpapers, carpets, stairs, fireplaces, and
  more. You can connect parts of your house via a deck or patio, or a balcony-type
  catwalk.
  .
  When first playing the game, you can choose to move your family into a pre-made
  neighborhood with different themes, or you can create one from scratch. If you
  have SimCity 4 and/or Rush Hour installed, you can import cities into The Sims 2
  to use custom neighborhoods.
  .
  The biggest change to the game is aging and fears/aspirations. Your Sims will
  now age, from a newborn to a toddler to a child to an adult and finally, to a
  senior. Your Sims will also eventually die of old age (or other means, for evil
  players), but there is a way to prolong your Sims youth.
  .
  This edition comes bundled with all released expansions.

  SkiFree is a single-player skiing computer game created by Chris Pirih and
  released with Microsoft Entertainment Pack 3 for Windows 3.0 in October
  1991. The player controls a skier on a mountain slope, avoiding obstacles
  while racing against time or performing stunts for points, depending on
  the game mode.
  .
  SkiFree was well-received upon release, with critics focusing on its
  simplicity and graphics. The game was ported to Macintosh and, years later,
  to Game Boy Color and iOS. Pirih also released a free, updated 32-bit
  Windows version after rediscovering his original source code. SkiFree
  remains popular among the gaming community and is often remembered for
  its Abominable Snowman, which pursues the player after they finish a full
  run.
  .
  In 2020, Microsoft released Surf, a game included with Microsoft Edge
  heavily inspired by SkiFree. A winter skin where the player skis instead
  of surfs and must run from the SkiFree Abominable Snowman was added to
  the game in 2021.

description:
  Jean-Luc Picard, captain of the Federation starship USS Enterprise-D, is on a
  mission to encounter an ultimate threat to the known galaxy. The game starts
  with a Federation outpost detecting an unknown ship approaching Federation
  space; the Enterprise is sent to deal with this new situation. The mystery ship
  appears to be a small scout-ship from Garid that has lost power to its engines
  and as a result has sailed off of its intended course. Suddenly, a Romulan
  Warbird battleship from Garid uncloaks itself right between the protagonist and
  the new ship, and thus a new story begins. A Final Unity is a hybrid game with
  adventure and strategy segments. Whilst on the ship the player can use the
  tactical console to engage in occasional battles against enemy, repair damaged
  systems, and select teams for away missions. These missions constitute the
  larger portion of the game, and are played like a traditional point-and-click
  adventure, including item manipulation and puzzle-solving. Dialogues may vary
  depending on the crew members previously selected by the player.

game: Star Wars - Dark Forces (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Disc/S/Star Wars - Dark Forces (USA)/Star Wars - Dark Forces (USA).json
developer: LucasArts Entertainment Company LLC
publisher: LucasArts
genre: Action
description:
  Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the
  Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility,
  he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base.
  This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various
  iterations of his Dark Troopers - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and
  firepower to turn the tide of the war. Dark Forces is a close prequel to the
  original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to
  enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the DOOM engine,
  like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal Jedi engine. The Jedi
  engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to
  look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark
  Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. The 3D models also make occasional
  appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or
  picking him up from each mission. Most levels have a fairly complex, often
  maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to
  change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as
  certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can
  use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark
  areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The
  player character is given a certain amount of "lives" per level; he dies
  permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only
  between missions. The game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to
  disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from
  the Star Wars movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to
  Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer. As opposed to
  most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for
  Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to
  planting charges around a facility to demolish it. Cutscenes appear between key
  missions to update the plot. The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, as the
  game features imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen
  in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as
  weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark
  Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action
  scenes, with much of the music based off or directly replicating, John Williams'
  original film score. The game is entirely a single-player campaign; no
  multiplayer is included or supported.

description:
  Kyle Katarn, a former mercenary and now an ally of the rebels, discovers that he
  is in fact a Jedi, and is on a quest to find his lightsaber and learn the
  techniques of the Force. The evil Sith lord Jerec, who was responsible for the
  death of Kyle's father, is on a quest of his own, searching a mythical place
  called Valley of the Jedi, where his dark powers could be unleashed. Will Kyle
  be able to stop Jerec and become a true Jedi without falling to the dark side?
  .
  Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Dark Forces II is a sequel to Dark Forces. The game is
  set in the Star Wars universe and its events occur after those depicted in the
  movie Return of the Jedi (Episode VI). Primarily a first-person 3D shooter, the
  game also allows the player to switch to third-person perspective. Kyle can use
  blasters and rifles to take care of his enemies, and later in the game he will
  also be able to fight enemies with a lightsaber.
  .
  There are three kinds of Force powers Kyle may use in the game: light, dark and
  neutral. Light powers are mostly used for healing purposes; dark powers involve
  violent actions such as choking enemies or hurling objects at them; neutral
  powers enhance Kyle's speed and jumping ability. There are fourteen Force powers
  altogether; if the player chooses to develop only one type of powers throughout
  the game, a bonus power can be gained. Completing levels rewards the player with
  stars, which can be allocated to enhance the powers.
  .
  The game has a branching storyline with different endings, and the player's
  decisions can lead Kyle to the light as well as the dark side (for example,
  killing innocents will add "dark points" to Kyle's score). The game features
  video sequences with live actors as cutscenes.

developer: BioWare
publisher: LucasArts
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Four thousand years before the events depicted in the Star Wars movies, the
  political and ideological situation is not much different from what we have seen
  in the prequel trilogy: the Republic and the Jedi Order are fighting against two
  powerful Sith lords, Darth Revan and his apprentice, Darth Malak. It is said
  that the former was successfully defeated by the Jedi, and that Darth Malak
  betrayed his mentor and is planning to take on the Republic by himself. His
  aggression is so successful that some Jedi have decided to join his ranks. A
  seemingly ordinary soldier of the Republic is traveling aboard a space ship that
  is attacked by Darth Malak's minions. Narrowly escaping, the soldier meets a
  female Jedi named Bastila, one of those who have fought Darth Revan in the
  decisive battle. With her help, the soldier must learn to become a Jedi, stop
  Darth Malak, and discover the truth about his or her own past.
  .
  Knights of the Old Republic is a role-playing game that uses the Star Wars D20
  rule system, which is similar to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
  Character development and combat are handled similarly to BioWare's previous
  RPGs such as Baldur's Gate series. Combat engine follows similar "real-time with
  pause" rules. There are only three active combatants on the player's side (as
  opposed to six in Baldur's Gate). Several characters join the party and can be
  switched at the player's will.
  .
  Eventually, the protagonist will have to train at the Jedi academy to earn a
  lightsaber and force moves. Force powers include stun, force pull (which pulls
  opponents or objects toward the player-controlled character), the Jedi Mind
  Trick, which persuades people to see things the player's way, and many others.
  The player has various weapons at his or her disposal, from the lightsaber to
  blasters, grenades, ion rifles, etc.
  .
  Throughout the game, the player will visit many Star Wars locations that
  appeared in the movies, such as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees, the
  desert planet of Tatooine, and others. Interacting with characters in various
  ways and performing side quests influences the protagonist's stand with the
  forces of Light and Darkness. The player can turn the main character into a
  flawless Jedi, a ruthless Sith, or anything in between. Some of the player's
  choices influence major events that occur within the storyline.

publisher: LucasArts
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Five years after the events depicted in Knights of the Old Republic, the Sith
  have become stronger and more determined to rule the Galaxy. The Jedi Order is
  nearly exterminated. A mysterious ex-Jedi has been exiled from the Order and is
  traveling alone. This Jedi had served under Darth Revan (when the latter was
  still on the Light side of the Force) during the Mandalorian Wars, but due to
  enigmatic circumstances was forced to retire. Now the past is catching up with
  the Jedi, and soon he or she will have to choose the side to fight on.
  .
  The Sith Lords looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, also being
  based on the Star Wars d20 role-playing rule set (which, in its turn, is similar
  to the 3rd Edition of Dungeons & Dragons) and having the same combat engine,
  character development, and a Light and Dark ethical system, which judges the
  player's decisions and actions and influences story events and characters'
  responses. Additions to the gameplay include a lightsaber-crafting system, which
  allows augmenting lightsabers with various items, new Force powers, and the
  possibility to influence the alignments of the characters in the
  player-controlled party through conversation choices and other decisions. Most
  of the exploration and the combat sequences is done using a party of three,
  including the protagonist and two companions. However, certain parts of the game
  will force the player to travel alone, or to control a party made exclusively
  out of companions.
  .
  A large part of the military equipment can be upgraded using any workbench that
  can be found throughout the game world, including one available at all times on
  the ship that the player uses to travel between planetary systems. Different
  types of items have more than one piece that can be augmented. For example, the
  armor has two slots for upgrades (overlay and underlay), while ranged weapons
  have three (targeting, firing chamber, and power pack), and lightsabers have
  six. The easiest way to get additional upgrades is to either buy them or loot
  them, however they can be created as well at a workbench with the right
  components and enough repair skill. Medical items are a different sort and they
  can be crafted using lab stations.
  .
  At various moments during the game, the player has the opportunity to play some
  mini games: a card game called Pazaak, shooting targets using a turret from a
  first-person view, and swoop racing.

description:
  The game's prologue (and tutorial) concerns Ace's "family missions" in which his
  elder family members and Emkay instruct him in the flying of Corellian
  transports so that he can begin working for the family.
  .
  These missions reveal that the Azzameen family are in heated competition with
  the Viraxo and are generally sympathetic to the Rebel Alliance. Due to their
  sympathies, the patriarch of the family, Tomaas Azzameen, smuggles bacta for the
  Alliance in the aftermath of the Battle of Hoth. This causes them to pay dearly
  as the Galactic Empire raids their home station for running bacta to an Alliance
  outpost. The family subsequently seeks asylum with a Rebel task force.
  .
  As a Rebel pilot, Ace participates in a variety of missions for the Rebellion
  while also helping his family fight the Viraxo. During his tour with the Rebel
  Alliance, he proves himself to be a significant pilot as he participates in
  missions that uncover new Imperial projects, such as experimental TIE fighters
  and the second Death Star.

  Tribes 2 is the sequel to Starsiege: Tribes. Like its predecessor, it is a
  team-based first-person-shooter designed primarily for online multiplay. While
  getting kills certainly helps, the player must also achieve the various
  objectives specified in the scenario, ranging from attack-and-hold objective, to
  assaults on enemy fortresses, taking enemy flags, and more. Each member must
  weigh the trade-off between firepower and protection, as well how much ammo to
  carry. Tribes 2 adds vehicles to the mix, as well as a new race, and larger
  maps.
  .
  Weapons vary from the sniper laser rifle to chain guns to grenade launchers to
  the massive mortar. Tribes 2 adds three brand new weapons, including melee shock
  lance, missile launcher (used against the new air vehicles), and ELF gun (drains
  energy from target). This had one of the finest in game friend and foe systems
  and was open to lots of minor mods that could be used to improve the experience
  as long as it didn't impact the basics of play it was allowed. Because of this
  it had a play system that has arguably never been bested in the genre.

  The protagonist Rusty is a robot who inherits a mine from his uncle. Since he
  additionally also received a pick-axe, the path is clearly laid out: exploring
  the mine and becoming rich! While the game starts with a Wild West atmosphere,
  later parts of the mine show steampunk elements.
  .
  Rusty can explore the mine by hacking away dirt with the pick-axe. The goal is
  to find treasure and additional equipment which is required to be able to
  proceed in other areas, e.g. a drill allows to break stone. However, those
  gadgets require water which can be refilled at water reserves which can be found
  in the mine. Other obstacles are traps, enemies, switch puzzles and platforming
  sequences. It is also advised to watch for rocks - when Rusty removes dirt under
  them, gravity comes into play.
  .
  The found precious metals or gems have to be sold on the surface - fortunately
  there are teleporter and elevators which shorten the way - for money which in
  turn is used to buy upgrades (e.g. more health points or a bigger capacity for
  carrying treasure) or equipment (e.g. dynamite for killing enemies, ladders or
  lanterns). Some upgrades additionally cost energy balls which can be found
  inside the mine. After dying, the people on the surface repair Rusty against a

  Stories: The Path of Destinies in an action RPG told as a fable. The roguish fox
  pirate Reynardo once plundered the Floating Isles of Boreas, but then swore to
  his mother his rover days were over. Over time the emperor that rules the lands
  changed, however, participating in strange rituals and working with Imperial
  Ravens who round up entire villages. So Reynardo returns, assisting the rebels
  to overthrow the emperor and his Ravens.
  .
  This game takes a different approach to tell its story. A single game consists
  of five levels and at the end of the first four a choice needs to be made.
  Reynardo can chase after a mighty weapon called the Skyripper, be lured by the
  Iblis stone, hunt after his lover-turned-enemy Zenobia, seek scientists, assist
  the rebels, rescue his friend Lapino and so on. The combination of the four
  choices leads to 19 unique stories with different story sequences. When one is
  completed, a card is added to a board with an overview of the choices, a
  summary, and the type of hero Reynardo has become. That means the game is meant
  to be played many times to experience different endings. At the same time,
  however, truths can be learned while playing. Truths make sure the consequences
  of actions are remembered in future playthroughs, signaled through icons, and
  this changes the dialogue, story events and possible choices. A single game is
  'completed' when four truths are combined, leading to different endings. After a
  while an optional 'truth seeker' option is unlocked to find the untrodden paths.
  .
  Supporting both direct control and point-and-select, Reynardo is steered through
  five levels based on ten available themes for each run. Not only is each level
  slightly different for each sessions, a Metroidvania aspect is also incorporated
  in the level design. Reynardo can collect up to four different swords that are
  used to open specific doors. Sometimes there are also branching paths, secrets,
  different teleport options and parts that were once locked are suddenly
  available. Reynardo needs to fight enemies using a combo and counter system. As
  he earns more experience and goes through different stories, a skill tree with
  up to four levels is available as skill points can be spent at altars on seven
  categories: combat, combo, dash, hook, stats (x2), and time.
  .
  Regular and epic chests can be looted for ore and other materials to craft and
  upgrade four swords (Firestorm, Hero Sword, Void Blade and Winterthorne), at
  workbenches. Each sword has a different fighting style and can be swapped on the
  fly. Each sword also has a unique fighting style based on fire, ice etc. tied to
  an energy meter. Certain parts in the environment can be destroyed for health,
  ore and energy. While fighting there are often multiple enemies, using spells,
  shields and so on. Reynardo can also use a dash move and a hook to bring enemies
  closer. The hook is also used while exploring to cross gaps. Certain levels have
  small puzzle elements based on levers, avoiding projectiles and stealth to
  defeat floating eyes. When dead, there is an unlimited amount of continues and
  checkpoints are set automatically.
  .
  Finally, the combat and playing style can be customized through gems. When these
  are found they can be equipped at workbenches in one of the three slots to
  provide additional resistance, faster speed, the ability to break shields etc.
  Gems have different levels that are upgraded when a second one of the same type
  is found. While certain environments are revisited multiple times in different
  configurations for the stories, the progression for items and enemy difficulty
  is tied to the overall progress.

description:
  Stunt Driver is a polygonal racing game released for MS-DOS in 1990. It has a
  feature set similar to Brderbund's Stunts published the same year, including a
  track editor, and both games have much in common with Hard Drivin', the Atari
  Games 3D stunt driving simulator released in February 1989.
  .
  Stunt Driver allows the user to create a racetrack from components such as draw-
  bridges, banked curves, oil slicks, water hazards, and loops, then race on them
  alone, against computer-controlled opponents, or against another user via a
  modem or null-modem connection. It allows viewing and editing of replays using
  different cameras, another feature shared with Stunts.

developer: Minor Key Games, LLC.
publisher: IndieBox, Inc.
genre: Platform
description:
  Super Win the Game is the successor to the freeware game You Have to Win the
  Game. Like the first part the game is a puzzle platformer, this time resembling
  the visual style of a classical NES game.
  .
  Again you play as a nameless hero called the Wayfarer. To win the game you will
  have to collect six fragments of the king's heart, who has been cursed by the
  Evil Wizard. As the player does not have any weapons he has to avoid any
  obstacles or enemies. Due to this and the high difficulty level with potentially
  lots of deaths of the player's character the gameplay may be compared with
  VVVVVV or l'Abbaye des Morts. However small bells numerously spread in the game
  world act as a checkpoints, so the game can be immediately resumed from there
  after dying.
  .
  Apart from the color upgrade the most prominent change to it's predecessor is
  the addition of an overworld map similar to the one found in Zelda II.
  Navigation is done on that map, but when entering a village or dungeon the
  perspective will switch to the platform view as discussed above.
  .
  Like in the first part the game can simulate a CRT screen, resembling a broad
  range of visual side effects like Persistence (causing motion blur), NTSC
  Scanlines or Bleeding as seen on many old TVs. Or (exclusive to the boxed
  version) you may switch on Anaglyph output for 3D effects with red-cyan glasses.

  Tux Racer is a 2000 open-source winter sports racing video game starring the
  Linux mascot, Tux the penguin. It was originally developed by Jasmin Patry as
  a computer graphics project at the University of Waterloo. Later on, Patry
  and the newly founded Sunspire Studios, composed of several former students
  of the university, expanded it. In the game, the player controls Tux as he
  slides down a course of snow and ice collecting herring.
  .
  Tux Racer was officially downloaded over one million times as of 2001. It
  also was well received, often being acclaimed for the graphics, fast-paced
  gameplay, and replayability, and was a fan favorite among Linux users and
  the free software community. The game's popularity secured the development
  of a commercialized release that included enhanced graphics and multiplayer,
  and it also became the first GPL-licensed game to receive an arcade
  adaptation. It is the only product that Sunspire Studios developed and
  released, after which the company liquidated. The free game's source code
  has led to it receiving forks, made by fans continuing its development.

  TIGER Assaults are short competitions based around a particular theme.  The

  projects.  I.e., it's an exercise in making small, tight,
  enjoyable/interesting games that can be played from beginning to end. There
  are no prizes involved.
  .
  Any format goes!  But the game must at least run on Win32 platforms.  Sorry.
  .
  How do I make an entry for the competition?
  .
  1. First, open up the Video Game Name Generator.
  2. Next, find a name for the game that you want to make.
  (Peeing your pants out of mirth is recommended during this part.)
  3. Finally, MAKE THAT GAME.
  .
  Rules: Entries should be started and ended within the timeframe of the
  competition (feel free to put up your game threads and begin brainstorming
  earlier, though) and must be made for the competition only.  Collaborations
  are allowed and, in fact, are welcomed.  You may submit more than one game.

  Wasteland 2 is the sequel to the 1988 title Wasteland. The game lets the player
  take control of a squad of rangers, in an attempt to explore the surrounding
  world, solve quests and defeat enemies.

  first Wasteland, kicking off with the player being tasked with finding out what
  happened to an experienced ranger who died in mysterious circumstances.
  Throughout the story, the player encounters enemies, quests, and different
  puzzles. The game lets players choose their own way to approach any situation
  they encounter, with skills, items and quests having an important impact on the
  surrounding world.
  .
  The party can consist of seven characters, up to four designed by the player
  with specific statistics, skills, opinions and traits, and three or more NPCs.
  The game puts a large emphasis on choice and consequence permanently affecting
  the characters and the game world.

  Wasteland 2: Director's Cut is an enhanced version of Wasteland 2. For Xbox One
  and PS4 it is the first version of the game. For PC it is provided as a digital
  download for free to owners of the original version and it can also be bought
  separately. For GOG and Steam it does not replace the default version and it is
  available separately. Save files cannot be transferred.
  .
  The graphics have been overhauled and the game engine has been updated to Unity
  5. Improvements affect character models and environment art. There are also new
  visual effects for fire and explosions. Through Unity 5's physically-based
  rendering system, there are more realistic lighting conditions. The voice-overs
  are expanded with new voices. For the game mechanics a precision strike system
  is added to target individual body parts (head, torso, arms, legs) with negative
  status effects, similar to V.A.T.S. in Fallout games. There is a new perk system
  where a perk point is provided for every four character levels. The available
  perks depend on the character's skills. During character generation a quirk can
  be chosen, a specific personality trait that is permanent. There is rebalanced
  gameplay for weapon statistics, container locations, content scenes, merchant
  inventories, loot drops and more.
  .
  Changes during combat for enemy placement, numbers and cover positions have been
  implemented as well. There are new weapons in the game, found in hidden
  containers or carried by NPCs. The armour system is updated to make heavy armour
  conductive. This mainly affects the use of energy weapons as they do bonus
  damage against conductive armour and less damage against normal targets, instead
  of scaling the armour value. Along with the console release there is controller
  support for the PC versions.

  In Wetrix the player must build barriers on the arena to stop the water from
  leaking out. As time progresses, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so the

  much on the screen will start an earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the
  water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in walls, and fireballs vaporize the water. The
  aim is to get as high a score as possible. There is a practice mode available,
  and the game can be played in multiplayer against a friend.

developer: 2D Boy
publisher: 2D Boy
genre: Puzzle;Strategy
description:
  The game is built around the idea of creating large structures using balls of
  goo. The game is divided into five chapters, each containing several levels.
  Each level has its own graphic and musical theme, giving it unique atmosphere,
  similar in style to Tim Burton's film designs. There is also a bonus meta-game
  called World of Goo Corporation, where the objective is to build the highest
  tower using goo balls which the player collected through the course of the game.
  Players from all over the world can compete, as the height of the tower and
  number of goo balls used are being constantly uploaded to the 2D Boy server.

game: Z - The Game (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Disc/Z/Z - The Game (USA)/Z - The Game (USA).json
developer: Tic Toc Games
publisher: KISS ltd
genre: Strategy
description:
  Z is a real-time strategy game in which you fight for control of the sectors,
  some of which contains manufactories that can gain you additional units. Touch
  the "flag" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit
  comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different
  robots (different armaments, armor, and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to
  tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the
  opponent's base, and prevent him from doing the same to you.
  .
  The game differs from many other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and
  the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a big army. You have
  to finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long, the enemy will grab
  all the manufactories first. If you go too fast, you'll get hammered for
  stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the
  driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a
  vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle; you don't really need
  to micromanage each soldier.
