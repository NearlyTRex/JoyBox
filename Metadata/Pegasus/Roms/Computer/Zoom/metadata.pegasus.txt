developer: Rebellion
publisher: Fox Interactive
genre: Action;Horror;Shooter
description:
  Aliens Versus Predator is a sci-fi first-person shooter based on the associated
  two film franchises. The game has three playable species, and each has its own
  single-player campaign with different missions and plotlines.
  .
  - Aliens... Their only weapons are their own body parts: claws for close combat,
  their deadly tail, and their inner mouth that can crack through an enemy's skull
  (for an instant kill) if close enough. They are deadly at close range, and can
  heal by eating corpses or the heads of unsuspecting enemies. They can't be hurt
  through falls, and an alternate vision mode allows them to see clearly ahead
  through darkness. Their strength lies in flexibility and speed, and an ability
  to cling to walls and run along any surface - allowing a skilled player to
  escape or ambush from literally any 3D direction.
  .
  - Humans... U.S. Marines, as portrayed by Michael Biehn in the film 'Aliens'.
  Marines have strong firepower that ranges from the self-tracking SmartGun, all
  the way to rocket launchers and devistating six-barrel miniguns (as seen in
  'Predator'). The Marines are the most familiar species to play as, with the
  gameplay style of typical FPS hero. However, their frailty at close range, and
  missions that leave them stranded, alone, surrounded by bloodthirsty
  extraterrestrials, make their experience closer to survival horror.
  .
  - Predators... Their power is their strength, and their sight. They have at
  least four ways of seeing the environment - standard vision, heat vision
  (highlighting Marines), electromagnetic vision (highlighting Aliens), and
  "Pred-Tech" (for highlighting fellow Predators and their technology). Their
  weapons are the most precise, deadly, and ranged of those in the game, being
  ideally suited to stealth-based gameplay. Predators also have the ability to
  zoom their view in and out when seeking someone, thus allowing them to snipe
  from afar. Their cloaking ability also renders them nearly invisible to enemy
  Marines.
  .
  There are several multiplayer modes. For a difficult game, you can pit all the
  players against the horde of computer creatures (which includes experimental
  robotic Aliens and tough Predalien hybrids). Alternatively, players can choose
  their favorite species and face each other in an arena-style deathmatch.
  .
  Aliens Versus Predator: Gold Edition is a compilation with the following
  content:
  .
  - Aliens Versus Predator\n
  - Aliens Versus Predator: Millennium Expansion Pack\n
  - A strategy guide
  .
  Parts of the game were also reworked for this edition.

description:
  haraoh's Tomb is a DOS platform game created by George Broussard and published
  by Apogee Software.
  .
  The game features CGA graphics based on the FAST (Fluid Animation Software
  Technology) engine. Notoriously, objects' positions are determined by their
  bounding volumes, not their pixel precise positions on screen.
  .
  The protagonist, Nevada Smith (a play on Indiana Jones), is an archaeologist and
  adventurer who is exploring an Egyptian pyramid, hoping to find the Pharaoh's
  Tomb and get evidence of his findings.
  .
  Gameplay is straightforward. In each level, the player navigates and avoids
  obstacles by jumping or falling, evading or killing enemies, and find keys to
  exit each level. Nevada Smith has no life bar, and is killed instantly when he
  touches enemies or traps. Lethal obstacles include pyramid themed traps, such as
  blocks that fire projectiles when Smith passes in front of them, wall spikes,
  ceiling spikes and floor spikes. Navigational challenges include moving
  platforms and elevators. Bonus points are randomly concealed in some bricks,
  which are awarded when hit from below. The game contains many dead-ends as
  'traps' where Smith can become permanently stuck, forcing the player to either
  quit or reload a saved game. Collecting 100 coins or 5 masks earns the player an
  extra life.

  In the late 21st century, NASDA (the North American Strategic Defense Agency)
  developed and deployed a massive missile defense system, including a network of
  nuclear-equipped satellites and ground-based launch sites. However, during a
  routine maintenance check, something went terribly wrong...
  .
  While most of the survivors form scavenger bands to survive, one group of
  people, who refer to themselves as "The Project", seeks to rebuild civilization
  using pre-war technology.
  .
  Warzone 2100 is a real-time strategy game, originally developed by Pumpkin
  Studios and published by Eidos Interactive, now developed by the Warzone 2100
  Project. Compared to other real-time strategy games, it has a greater focus on
  artillery, radar, and counter-battery technologies, more frequent in-game
  cinematic updates as game play progresses, a massive research tree, as well as a
  vehicle design system.
  .
  Outside of the story, Warzone 2100 only has a single faction. This limits some
  of the variety that can be expected from real-time strategy games, although the
  single faction is very complex. Essentially, Warzone 2100 plays much like Earth
  2150 with 3D units and terrain, customizable vehicles, a lack of traditional
  infantry, use of "research" to acquire new technologies, and the differentiation
  of vehicles types.

developer: Tic Toc Games
publisher: KISS ltd
genre: Strategy
description:
  Z is a real-time strategy game in which you fight for control of the sectors,
  some of which contains manufactories that can gain you additional units. Touch
  the "flag" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit
  comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different
  robots (different armaments, armor, and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to
  tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the
  opponent's base, and prevent him from doing the same to you.
  .
  The game differs from many other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and
  the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a big army. You have
  to finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long, the enemy will grab
  all the manufactories first. If you go too fast, you'll get hammered for
  stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the
  driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a
  vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle; you don't really need
  to micromanage each soldier.
