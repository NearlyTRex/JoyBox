description:
  After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of
  nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again flourished under
  the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild
  the planet. These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or center, of
  the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong
  hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... And now, they have been
  seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of
  the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands,
  and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!
  The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest
  and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you
  must penetrate each of the 8 Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes'
  soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant
  wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to
  retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards. Then, to complete your quest, return the
  8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he
  may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of
  all mankind!

  .
  .
  Game List:
  .
  .
  Castlevania (1987/US, 1988/EU) NES
  .
  You're in for the longest night of your life. Ghosts, goblins, demons, wolves,
  bats creatures lurking around every corner. Better pick up a weapon or two,
  because when you finally meet the Count, you know he'll be going for the
  jugular.
  .
  .
  Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (1988/US, 1990/EU) NES
  .
  This title tells the tale of Simon's subsequent adventures following the events
  in Castlevania. Unlike the previous installment, this one was developed as an
  action RPG. It maintains the action elements of its predecessor but mainly
  focuses on exploration and puzzle solving within a far more expansive game
  world.
  .
  .
  Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse (1990/US, 1992/EU) NES
  .
  Led by the immortal Count Dracula, the greatest army of evil ever assembled is
  poised to bury mankind in a tomb of terror. Destroying His legions will be the
  supreme challenge for the mightiest warrior.
  .
  100 years before Simon Belmont's birth, Dracula is young at heart and it will
  take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of
  Trevor - Simon's forefather and the original vampire slayer.
  .
  .
  Super Castlevania IV (1991/US, 1992/EU) SNES
  .
  A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end. Once
  again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they
  shrink from new horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And
  this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.
  .
  .
  Castlevania: The Adventure (1989/US, 1991/EU) GB
  .
  This is the first title in the series to be released on the Game Boy handheld
  game console. The variety of power-ups available for the whip added depth to the
  strategy of the gameplay.
  .
  .
  Castlevania: Belmont's Revenge (1991/US, 1992/EU) GB
  .
  Fifteen years after vanquishing the evil Count Dracula, Christopher Belmont now
  faces a vampire swearing vengeance. Drac's back. And he's turned your son,
  Soleil Belmont, into a deadly demon to do his dirty deeds. To rescue him from
  the Count's clutches, you must first track him down through four creep packed
  castles.
  .
  .
  Castlevania Bloodlines (1994) GEN
  .
  Unlike the medieval setting of the other titles, this installment takes place
  during World War I. It introduces new elements to the series, such as the
  ability to choose one of two characters when starting the game. Huge bosses with
  dynamic, multi-jointed limbs that move erratically are just one of the many
  examples of the cutting-edge effects the game had for the time.
  .
  .
  Kid Dracula (1990/Japan exclusive) NES
  .
  With its laugh-inducing content and world full of gags, this spinoff is unlike
  anything else in the series. Players take control of Dracula's son (or so he
  says...), Kid Dracula, as he goes on a hilarious adventure filled with laughs
  that also satisfies as a full-fledged action game.

  Morgan Shane has disappeared, leaving a bloody trail of mayhem in her wake.
  But is she a monster or a victim of something far more sinister than the
  authorities are imagining? And the biggest question of all: Can you unravel
  the mystery before the same dark force that targeted Morgan finds you?
  .
  Daemon_9 is not a movie... it's not a game... it's both. It's like a horror
  movie inside an escape room that puts YOU in the heart of the story.
  Full-motion video, graphic images and challenging brain teasers intertwine to
  spin a deeply layered story of supernatural terror and mystery.
  .
  GAMEPLAY:
  .
  When you first launch Daemon_9 you are greeted by a message from an anonymous
  friend of Morgan's who is on a mission to find and save her -- and uncover
  the truth of what happened to her. Desperate for help, he is asking for your
  help. Your only tool is a backup of his hard drive. And that's where your
  journey begins -- sifting through the material he's unearthed in his quest
  for the truth. But the real challenge is to keep from falling victim to the
  same dark forces that claimed his friends, and by "getting involved" you may
  have made yourself vulnerable.
  .
  The trail will eventually lead you out onto the web and into a different kind
  of web -- one woven with international conspiracy and supernatural forces.
  You will need wits, patience, and nerve to unravel the mystery, save Morgan,
  and save yourself.

  Dead Cells puts you in control of a failed alchemic experiment trying to figure
  out what's happening on a sprawling, ever-changing and seemingly cursed Island.
  Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, permadeath and of
  course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble, make for a
  demanding, visceral and cathartic action game.
  .
  Experience a roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and
  unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath. No
  checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go, or you try again.
  However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs; new paths you've
  unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.
  .
  Speaking of weapons, Dead Cells features a plethora of ways to slay your
  enemies. A large variety of swords, bows and of course spells, but also whips,
  grenades and turrets, each one with its own unique twist. Plus, mutations and
  scrolls allow you to build and customize your character differently with each
  and every run.
  .
  At the end of the day though, it's your skills as a player that matter most!
  Roguelites are about constantly sharpening your skills, until what was an
  insurmountable obstacle becomes a walk in the park. Patience, you'll get better!
  ... eventually.
  .
  FEATURES:
  .
  * Roguevania: The progressive exploration of an interconnected world, with the
  replayability of a rogue-lite and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath.
  .
  * 2D Souls-lite Action: Tough but fair combat, the iconic dodge roll, more than
  90 weapons and spells with unique gameplay... The unforgiving action wed to the
  absence of any kind of safety net makes for an adrenalin pumping ride each and
  every run.
  .
  * Nonlinear Progression: Sewers, Ossuary or Ramparts? Once unlocked, special
  permanent abilities allow you to access new paths to reach your objective. Opt
  for the path that suits your current build, your play style, or just your mood.
  .
  * Exploration: Secret rooms, hidden passages, charming landscapes. Take a moment
  to stroll the towers and breath in that fresh sea mist infused air.

  THE FATE OF THE CITY IS IN YOUR HANDS
  .
  .
  It's been 15 years since humanity lost to the virus.
  .
  .
  The last great human settlement exists within an unforgiving, infected world,
  plunged into a modern dark age. During the day, bandits, factions and starving
  survivors roam the streets scavenging for scraps - or someone to take them from,
  by violence if necessary. At night the infected roam free, evacuating their dark
  hideouts to prey on the living.
  .
  .
  You are Aiden Caldwell, an infected survivor. Your exceptional agility and
  brutal combat skills make you a powerful ally and a valuable commodity in this
  dangerous world. You can achieve things no one else can. Enter places no one
  else dares. With your unique abilities you have the power to be an agent of
  change within this decaying metropolis.
  .
  .
  YOUR CHOICES, YOUR WORLD
  .
  You must make tough decisions and hard sacrifices as you decide the fate of a
  society on the brink of collapse. The effect of the choices you make will have a
  huge impact on entire regions of the city, uncovering new land masses and areas
  to explore. Play the entire campaign in up to four-player co-op. Host your own
  games or join other players' and see how their choices have played out
  differently to your own.
  .
  .
  EXCEPTIONAL AGILITY AND BRUTAL COMBAT
  .
  On your journey from humble beginnings to a person of great power, you have
  unprecedented freedom of movement across the city, seamlessly integrated with
  brutal first person combat.
  .
  .
  A MODERN DARK AGE
  .
  In a desperate city, where resources and power are scarce, unstable, and trust
  in ruling bodies is all but eroded; humankind has reverted to a dark age.
  Civilization is gone but the relics are still there. This is a violent, primal &
  unforgiving world - and so are its inhabitants.
  .
  .
  THE INFECTION HAS EVOLVED
  .
  The infection has evolved and become more sensitive to UV light. Society exists
  in the relative safety of sunlight, while the infected hide in the shadows of
  buildings. At night the infected roam the streets freely searching for prey,
  presenting opportunities for you to explore areas of the city inaccessible by
  day.

genre: Adventure;Text
description:
  The year is 1951, somewhere in a small town in Italy; and the lives of five
  women are about to take an unwanted dip into the dark waters of despair…
  .
  You take on the role of a young woman called Libretto Pansatto, an aspiring
  violinist in her early twenties. Having recently suffered the loss of her
  mother, Libretto has never felt more hopeless. But in the midst of her life’s
  biggest tragedy, an exciting opportunity makes itself known – as she receives
  an invitation to watch her closest friend perform at the grand re-opening of
  the symphony hall in town.
  .
  Soon after arriving at the hall, Libretto feels death is in the air around
  her…and realizes that this isn’t just any performance – but perhaps the last
  song that humanity might ever hear...
  .
  The Ghost of You is a 510,000+ word epic about love, loss, and survival. You
  make the choices that shape Libretto’s character; and you shape just what
  kind of an ending you get. With two romance routes and ten possible endings,
  will you end up with the girl you love, or will you end up alone? Will you
  fight the evil going on in this place, or will you join it? And most
  importantly – will you survive the madness of the symphony hall?
  .
  Are you prepared for what’s to come?

  reborn and revitalized. This 6-game epic culminates in multiple entirely canon,
  extremely different endings. Each step of the journey has you choose from
  options such as a Teleporter or calling in your buddy Charles to help you out.
  Correct choices will move the story forward, but incorrect choices lead to a
  fail. If you get to the end on your first try, you're doing it wrong. Failing is
  half the fun.
  .
  .
  The Henry Stickmin games have seen some good times on the internet, but age has
  not been kind. Breaking the Bank has been completely reanimated from scratch.
  Escaping the Prison, Stealing the Diamond, Infiltrating the Airship and Fleeing
  the Complex have all had their backgrounds and sound effects redone!
  .
  .
  A final game, Completing the Mission, is is featured in this collection. It's
  brand new, never before seen online! Cap off the series with a game 3x bigger
  than any of the previous games in the series.

  across five expansive campaigns. You'll play as one of four new survivors armed
  with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition

  Beat up strange baddies and win Loot Cards which give you special abilities.

  precious resources you need to heal and use powerful abilities.

  Careful though because baddies can loot you! The cards they steal drop into
  other players’ games. When you defeat an Elite Baddie you’ll get another
  player’s card: will you return it or keep it for yourself?

  Either way, prepare for a visit from that player's Holographic Helper to
  shower you with thanks or terrible vengeance - Loot Rascals is a tale of
  friendship, loss, and redemption!

  Screencheat is the ridiculous split-screen shooter where everyone is invisible
  so you have to screencheat (Screencheat - verb: to look at your opponents
  screens. Stop screencheating you cheater!). Master a wide variety of one-hit
  kill weapons including a blunderbuss, a car engine that shoots bouncing plasma
  balls and a teddy bear loaded with explosives. Train your skills in the solo
  time trials then engage in fast and frantic combat with up to eight players
  locally on the couch or online. With colourful maps, unique modes and a huge
  number of customisation options including wacky mutators, Screencheat is the
  ultimate party FPS.
  .
  .
  Ten unique and crazy weapons
  .
  .
  Ranging from the dependable Blunderbuss to the heroic Hobby Horse to the
  completely crazy Chefolet (a car engine that fires ricocheting energy balls),
  all are designed to deliver deadly satisfaction. Each weapon comes with its own
  unique advantages and disadvantages, encouraging wildly different play styles.
  These include not only the way a weapon shoots but also the "tells" the weapon
  leaves such as the smoke from the blunderbuss or the trail of fire behind the
  Hobby Horse.
  .
  .
  Nine game modes on or offline
  .
  .
  From traditional favorites such as Deathmatch to the completely unique Murder
  Mystery that challenges you to find and frag your specific target with a
  specific weapon. Play in teams or all against all. Challenge up to seven of your
  mates on the couch or online or a combination of both -- the game is always
  split screen whether you are on or offline. When your friends aren't around,
  test your skills in the solo time trials or play against AI bots.
  .
  .
  Map designed for rapid navigation
  .
  .
  In the spirit of the best arena shooters, youll spend time traversing 11 maps
  via air vents and trampolines until youve acquired your target and fragged them
  accordingly. Each map is designed with color-coded areas as well as plentiful
  landmarks such as statues, paintings, and furniture that allow you to quickly
  locate other players without being able to actually see them.
  .
  .
  Customize and mutate
  .
  .
  Inspired by games like Towerfall, we've provided players with a highly granular
  level of customisation to play the game the way they want to. Choose which
  weapons you'll allow, how and when they can be swapped or reloaded, apply time
  limits, adjust the victory conditions, penalties, and more. To really mix it up,
  add some Mutators such as slow mode, low gravity, or flappy jump.

  Beware the shadows and the darkness which seem silent. Beware the closed doors,
  the whispering mirrors. Beware the Song of Horror that nests in the cracks of
  your mind.
  .
  .
  The famed writer Sebastian P. Husher has gone missing, along with his entire
  family. Worried, his editor sent an assistant to his house in order to look for
  him but he never came back... These disappearances spark a set of events that
  will soon reveal something dreadful: a nameless, dark entity known only as The
  Presence seems to be responsible and it's still somewhere, out there, lurking in
  the shadows, waiting for you... You may die, but the horror continues others
  will pick the investigation up from where you left it until you all find out the
  origin of The Presence and put an end to this nightmare.
  .
  .
  A PARANORMAL ADVENTURE OF UNPREDICTABLE TERROR
  .
  Song of Horror offers a truly dynamic terror experience: its antagonist, the
  supernatural entity known only as The Presence, is controlled by an advanced AI
  (Artificial Intelligence) that adapts to your actions and decisions. Experience
  unbearable fear as this otherworldly being responds to your way of playing and
  hunts you down in unexpected ways, offering a unique experience to every player
  and gameplay where tension builds up naturally instead of coming from scripted
  sequences.
  .
  .
  As a player, you will live this story through the eyes of a varied set of
  characters related to the story in their own way. Every character is different,
  and brings their unique point of view to the investigation, allowing them to
  approach clues and items differently. Their actions and decisions will shape the
  world: some of them will know more or less of certain aspects of the story; some
  will be more effective against supernatural manifestations, but all of them can
  die if the Presence gets to them and death is permanent. If they die, you will
  have to pick the story up with another one, and continue the investigation so
  their deaths are not in vain.

  .
  * You may die, but the horror continues: death is permanent when a character
  dies, it's gone...but the next one will follow the investigation from where the
  deceased left it. The world will be shaped by their previous actions.

  You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with
  hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you
  learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home?
  It won't be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life
  have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town's most vibrant hub
  of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity.
  With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to
  greatness!
  .
  .
  Features:
  .
  .
  * Turn your overgrown field into a lively farm! Raise animals, grow crops, start
  an orchard, craft useful machines, and more! You'll have plenty of space to
  create the farm of your dreams.
  .
  .
  * Improve your skills over time. As you make your way from a struggling
  greenhorn to a master farmer, you'll level up in 5 different areas: farming,
  mining, combat, fishing, and foraging. As you progress, you'll learn new cooking
  and crafting recipes, unlock new areas to explore, and customize your skills by
  choosing from a variety of professions.
  .
  .
  * Become part of the local community. With over 30 unique characters living in
  Stardew Valley, you won't have a problem finding new friends! Each person has
  their own daily schedule, birthday, unique mini-cutscenes, and new things to say
  throughout the week and year. As you make friends with them, they will open up
  to you, ask you for help with their personal troubles, or tell you their
  secrets! Take part in seasonal festivals such as the luau, haunted maze, and
  feast of the winter star.
  .
  .
  * Explore a vast, mysterious cave. As you travel deeper underground, you'll
  encounter new and dangerous monsters, powerful weapons, new environments,
  valuable gemstones, raw materials for crafting and upgrading tools, and
  mysteries to be uncovered.
  .
  .
  * Breathe new life into the valley. Since JojaMart opened, the old way of life
  in Stardew Valley has changed. Much of the town's infrastructure has fallen into
  disrepair. Help restore Stardew Valley to it's former glory by repairing the old
  community center, or take the alternate route and join forces with Joja
  Corporation.
  .
  .
  * Court and marry a partner to share your life on the farm with. There are 10
  available bachelors and bachelorettes to woo, each with unique character
  progression cutscenes. Once married, your partner will live on the farm with
  you. Who knows, maybe you'll have kids and start a family?
  .
  .
  * Spend a relaxing afternoon at one of the local fishing spots. The waters are
  teeming with seasonal varieties of delicious fish. Craft bait, bobbers, and crab
  pots to help you in your journey toward catching every fish and becoming a local
  legend!
  .
  .
  * Donate artifacts and minerals to the local museum.
  .
  .
  * Cook delicious meals and craft useful items to help you out. With over 100
  cooking and crafting recipes, you'll have a wide variety of items to create.
  Some dishes you cook will even give you temporary boosts to skills, running
  speed, or combat prowess. Craft useful objects like scarecrows, oil makers,
  furnaces, or even the rare and expensive crystalarium.
  .
  .
  * Customize the appearance of your character and house. With hundreds of
  decorative items to choose from, you'll have no trouble creating the home of
  your dreams!
  .
  .
  * Xbox controller support (with rumble)! (Keyboard still required for text
  input)
  .
  .
  * Over two hours of original music.
