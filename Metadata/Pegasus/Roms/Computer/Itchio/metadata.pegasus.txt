description:
  Visit a quiet town in the Peruvian desert at night searching for spirits and
  taking photos, then sharing these pictures with locals who free-associate based
  on them. This game is based on time I spent with a brujo in the desert suburb of
  Cachiche, a town that was founded by witches during the Peruvian Inquisition.
  Here descendants of witches still live and continue to practice traditional
  healing and fortune-telling.

  "What works here is that uncertainty space... In a number of places you'll see
  shadows that don't have a body. And you'll also see people discussing secrets in
  dark rooms or running past you hurriedly from behind fences. But this only adds
  to the underlying feeling of something sinister and ominous present, watching
  you, following you wherever you go..."

  10 Flights of Ballooning is a cornucopia of games based on the Balloon Trip mode
  in the original Balloon Fight.
  .
  Relish in discovering the different flavors of games.
  .
  What ingredients can be added, subtracted, substituted, etc. to the original
  recipe? What are the resulting dishes?
  .
  I don't know about you, but I'm hungry.
  .
  Enjoy!
  .
  Serious stuff:
  .
  This was made in a graduate class based on Pippin Barr's 2016 IndieCade East
  talk, "36 Reasons to Make the Same Game 36 Times."
  .
  10 Flights works on PC and Mac OSX. You can use a keyboard, a DualShock 4
  controller, or whatever Xbox controller you have (tested with Xbox One and Xbox
  360). There's a readme in there with more info, but I strongly suggest you just
  boot up the game and play and have a good time.
  .
  The credits are in the secret game. Try to unlock them and see all the people I
  thanked!
  .
  Update 5-1-2017
  .
  I fixed some typos in the credits and also made sure the Mac build is correct.
  Balloon Light should play correctly now, and a couple of other minor issues that
  nobody will ever notice were also fixed.

  10 games, each made in a week! Some were a bit of a bust, others were pretty
  rad.
  .
  These games are simple prototypes, proof of concepts, or unfinished works. This
  bundle serves as a bit of a time capsule for me, but also for the curious or
  those who might go on a similar journey!
  .
  Week 1 - DRIFTING Through Time
  .
  Theme: 10 seconds or less.
  .
  Turning your car sideways is SO COOL it FREEZES TIME! Drift to stop time, get as
  many laps as you can before time runs out!
  .
  Week 2 - Dog Ownership Simulator
  .
  Theme: Durational
  .
  Play with your dog! Click and drag to give it a spin, swipe on poos to clean
  them up!
  .
  Week 3 - Chillin' Bayside
  .
  Theme: Melbourne
  .
  A simple little physics toy inspired by summer holidays on the great ocean road.
  Kinda like playing around in a bath - click and hold the mouse to push stuff
  around :)
  .
  Week 4 - Paint the Town Red
  .
  Theme: Colour
  .
  Bounce around the world and paint as you go, cherry tomato! A game dedicated to
  a personal friend of mine.
  .
  Week 5 - RONG
  .
  Theme: Phsyics
  .
  An inter-dimensional pong remix, RONG has you sticking it out for the highest
  score! Made in collab. with divlauren!
  .
  Week 6 - ???
  .
  Theme: Legedermain
  .
  Originally supposed to be about a magician who had his many hats stolen, this
  unfinished puzzle platform has never seen the light of day.
  .
  Week 7 - Pineapple Pipeline
  .
  Theme: Camerawork
  .
  A simple skateboarding game down an infinite half-pipe. This game was inspired
  by fish-eye lenses used in skateboarding videos.
  .
  Week 8 - Tandem Toobs
  .
  Theme: Gift
  .
  I made this game as a gift for my parents. Currently unfinished, but intended to
  be a co-op platformer, each player controls one half of two cylinders, and has
  to co-ordinate to move around.
  .
  Week 9 - Beach Bird Volleyball
  .
  Theme: Minigame
  .
  Beach Bird Volleyball stars buff seagulls using their floppy fists to fight it
  out in games of volleyball.
  .
  Week 10 - Mouse racing game
  .
  Theme: Weird Input
  .
  This game is played by turning your mouse upside down and revving up the
  mousewheel like a pullback car.
  .
  Week 11 - Spider Playground
  .
  Theme: Playground
  .
  Spider playground is a unfinished little sandbox where you can explore a
  climable(ish) playground as a tiny spider.
  .
  You may notice that some of these projects are already available for free on my
  page. That is no mistake! This package will have all my games as they were
  completed when I was working through my game-a-week journey. The games I've
  chosen to upload separately might receive updates in the future, and some
  already have.
  .
  This bundle is an honest record of my successes and failures. I've also decided
  to charge for this, as truthfully there was a lot of labour put into these
  projects. If you're not interested in strange and possibly broken games, check
  out my page for finished works. But if you do, I hope they can bring you as much
  joy as they've brought me :)

  12 orbits is the only game for up to 12 players at once,
  .
  no matter what you play on.
  .
  All you need is a single keyboard, touchscreen, gamepad, dance mat, makey
  makey...
  .
  Features
  .
  Local competitive multiplayer for everyone at once. Anywhere. On anything.
  .
  4 vastly different game modes to choose from
  .
  Setup takes seconds, even for 12 players at once
  .
  The basic mechanics are simple and can be taught to a group quickly
  .
  ...yet the physical nature of the game provides you with a lot of room for
  mastery
  .
  One Switch accessible
  .
  You can choose from 4 vastly different game modes:
  .
  Multiball (Teams)
  .
  Kind of like football, but with exploding goals and multiple balls at once,
  which change color all the time.
  .
  Arena
  .
  Fill the arena with spheres of your own color and avoid those of your opponents.
  A bullet hell that constantly grows more intense.
  .
  Trails
  .
  Collect spheres to grow longer than your opponents. Block their path and pay
  attention to your own, similar to Snake or Achtung die Kurve / Zatacka. On top
  of that, you also have the ability to shoot with your own spheres.
  .
  Blizzard (Teams)
  .
  Think Pong. But you play in teams, can roam freely on your side of the court,
  and have to defend against a whole shower of spheres at once.
  .
  Some questions you might have:
  .
  * Why?
  .
  So you can play with everyone around you, anywhere. 12 orbits will run on almost
  any hardware, and any input will do. Most keyboards can only process 3 or 4
  inputs at the same time, but that does not mean you can only play with 3
  players.
  .
  12 orbits uses only one button per player, which you never have to keep pressed.
  So it is highly unlikely that many players use their button during the very same
  frame. While I can not guarantee that a three-button-keyboard will never ever
  miss a single input, there were no problems with any number of players yet.
  .
  If you are on the go, or simply do not have 12 gamepads lying around, that is
  why.
  .
  * Is this actually playable?
  .
  Yes! There are a few one-button-multiplayer games around that are fun or funny,
  but are based on a single action and don't really work for longer than 5
  minutes. 12 orbits is not one of those games. It is fun of course, but this is
  also a game that can actually be played competitively.
  .
  It will take you only a few minutes to get the hang of the controls, but it is
  much harder to actually master movement and to skillfully hit spheres exactly
  the way you want to. In addition, 12 orbits is a lot about anticipating the
  movements of other players, becoming almost chess-like if you have the right
  opponents.
  .
  You can of course also play the game in a more relaxed fashion, especially in
  the team modes or with activated modifications. It's your choice.
  .
  * How many players do I need?
  .
  2 is enough. All game modes automatically adjust to any number of players. There
  are also practice modes that can be played with 1 to 12 players on one team, but
  that isn't the main attraction of this game. So grab someone nearby, and add
  players as they turn up.
  .
  * Is 12 orbits One Switch accessible?
  .
  Yes. From the moment the game starts, it can be completely controlled with only
  the spacebar, including all menus. Just press it a few times when the main menu
  screen is shown, and on-screen prompts will further guide you through the
  process. More infos here.
  .
  * Is there a colorblind mode?
  .
  Yes. It is based on black and white symbols, so it should work for any type of
  color blindness.

  Hello. My name is Anxiety. Here, on your shoulder. This is your first day of
  high school.
  .
  You don't belong here.
  .
  In the dim, abandoned halls of the school, there are monsters - monsters with
  names like Guilt and Dysphoria, Insomnia and the Expectations that you can't
  seem to clear. With no clear way to leave, no way to get rid of the monsters,
  and no one to help, things are looking pretty bleak. The Anxiety that
  accompanies you sure seems to think so.
  .
  But remember, even in the darkest of places, you can't let your hope die. It's
  okay to get hurt, and it's okay to fall. And, most importantly: never give up.
  .
  --------
  .
  In 2016, just before I graduated from high school, I was asked to make a
  presentation on my last 1365 days at the school. I realized that I couldn't
  really remember, thanks to my many mental illnesses. So, instead, I made a game
  about what I could remember: a hostile world, bleak and full of inescapable
  monsters, but a world that I had just made it out of in one piece. 1365 is a
  reflection of my own struggles in overcoming Anxiety, Depression, and other such
  monsters of the mind, specifically in the context of public school.
  .
  While my understanding of myself and my world have changed drastically since I
  first started working on this game, I opted to keep the original concept intact.
  I've remade the original game entirely and added a few features that I didn't
  have time for, but otherwise the game is a time capsule to three years ago, when
  I finished its first incarnation.
  .
  Nearly every part of 1365 was made by me, including graphics, sound, code,
  writing, and concept. The only parts that weren't are the fonts (the main one is
  Little Monster by Jack Oatley), and the game engine itself, built by the Godot
  team. I couldn't have done it without them.
  .
  So, three years after its initial creation, I'm proud to present: 1365. I hope
  you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!

  .
  "Towards the end of the interstellar wars, chaos spread
  .
  and one band of elite mercenaries acted more like pirates
  .
  and looters than actual soldiers. The leader of this group
  .
  was the notorious and infamous Colonel Nestor.
  .
  Without a doubt the biggest prize of their looting campaigns
  .
  was the Spacemachine: a device designed to terraform barren
  .
  planets and making them habitable. With this device, and the rest
  .
  of their treasure, Nestor and his men started to build an army
  .
  that now poses a great threat to the known star systems.

  Mission: Bring back the Space Machine."

  2000:1: A Space Felony is a murder mystery courtroom drama set aboard the USS
  Endowment, an interplanetary Spacecraft that has lost communication with Earth.
  .
  Utilising your camera and demonstrating your keen detective skills, you must
  document your findings, and piece together the crew's final hours from the
  aftermath. This photographic evidence is then applied in a cross-examination of
  the crime's prime suspect; MAL, the ship's on-board AI system.
  .
  If MAL is guilty, it is your responsibility to deactivate him.

  A follow-up(ish) to 2016's critically acclaimed(ish) Disorient On The Murder
  Express, National Insecurities returns with a much more ambitious investigation
  that walks the line between science and fiction, resulting in some kind of
  combination of the two.

genre: Cyberpunk;Speculative fiction;Adventure
description:
  2064: Read Only Memories merges old-school adventure gaming with modern
  storytelling to explore some of the social challenges we will face in the near
  future. Explore the colorful future metropolis of Neo-San Francisco, meeting a
  huge cast of fascinating characters and solving a far-reaching mystery. Think
  carefully about your choices, because you never know how they will affect this
  dynamic, branching narrative further down the line.
  .
  The world is changing.
  .
  Genetic alteration of humans is now commonplace, with many choosing to radically
  alter their bodies to express their individuality. Virtual intelligences called
  ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Managers), created as simple digital
  assistants, are exerting greater control over people's lives. Some are terrified
  by this rapid change, and they are willing to go to extreme lengths to prevent
  it.
  .
  A lost ROM named Turing breaks into the apartment of a struggling journalist to
  ask for help. They claim to be the first sapient machine-not a simulation of
  life but a genuinely self-aware artificial being-and the technical genius who
  created them has gone missing. Can you unravel the shocking conspiracy that
  threatens to rock an entire society? Or will the darkness that lies behind the
  bright neon lights of Neo-SF consume you?
  .
  Old-school, cutting-edge - Classic point-and-click adventuring inspired by the
  likes of Gabriel Knight and Snatcher is melded with modern branching
  storytelling that delves into identity, individuality, and what it means to be
  human.
  .
  People of the future - Get to know a diverse cross-section of Neo-SF's
  population, brought to life by some of the best voice talent working in games
  today, including Melissa Hutchison and Dave Fennoy (The Walking Dead), Erin
  Yvette (Oxenfree), Austin Creed (WWE's Xavier Woods), and internet stars Jim
  Sterling (Jimquisition) and SungWon Cho (ProZD).
  .
  High tech nostalgia - The city of Neo-San Francisco is rendered in beautiful
  pixel art, and your adventure is accompanied by a catchy low-fi electronic synth
  soundtrack.
  .
  Solve the mystery - Enjoy over ten hours of adventure gaming goodness, featuring
  exploration, dynamic branching conversations, multiple endings, and many
  challenges to overcome.
  .
  The definitive PC edition - Since its launch two years ago, the team has made
  many improvements and additions to an already amazing game, making this the
  ultimate version. Additions have included new characters and voice performers,
  additional facial animations, Japanese language support, and the "Endless
  Christmas" extended epilogue that allows you to hang out with your favorite Neo-
  SF locals.
  .
  More about the Sights & Sounds of Neo-SF Deluxe Edition
  .
  Sights of Neo-SF (Artbook)
  .
  The world of 2064 can be hard to navigate. The Sights of Neo-SF is the official
  art book by Read Only Memories director and lead artist John "JJSignal" James.
  Highly stylized and specific in its visuals, ROM's progression from early
  sketches to final form is fully outlined in this 50-page PDF. You will see early
  concepts fully realized, previous versions of your favorite characters and even
  some characters that didn't make the final cut. JJ lists Bubblegum Crisis,
  Akira, Megazone 23, and the Pluto manga as his biggest style inspirations. Come
  see where the ideas behind the game began and watch them evolve into the vibrant
  city of Neo-SF we know and love.
  .
  Sounds of Neo-SF (Soundtrack)
  .
  Composed by 2 Mello, the Sounds Of Neo-SF is the FM-synthy, funky, and
  positively-charged soundtrack to MidBoss' cyberpunk adventure game Read Only
  Memories. Not content with a soundtrack that was merely fitting for its game, 2
  Mello crafted these sounds to embody the dual nature of Neo-San Francisco, all
  its charm and its hidden dangers. But who said that our cyberpunk future has to
  be dark and dreary? You'll be humming these melodies to 2064 and beyond.

  I like making games. Sometimes i make them just for the sake of making them and
  to enjoy the process. Here are 6 things that are too small to be posted or sold
  on their own, but are still something I'm proud of and want to share with the
  world.
  .
  Includes versions for all major OS + sourcecode for godot projects
  .
  Chat Stashers:
  .
  RP as undercover agents transmitting secret messages in plain sight. Played in
  your groupchat of choice, preferably full of people who are not aware you & your
  pals are playing. Includes a rulebook and a spreadsheet to keep track of active
  stashes and score. Inspired by the Stashers Bible, a russian essay of tips &
  best practices on how to make deaddrops in an urban environment.
  .
  Bubble Herder:
  .
  This January i joined a 2 day hackathon. For that hackathon i made a bubble
  diagram maker where bubbles can push and pull on each other to organize
  themselves. It ended up getting first place. I quite like it myself as well, so
  it will likely be turned into a full scale project when i have enough free time
  to do that.
  .
  Planet Maker:
  .
  Procedural planet generator, looks pretty, sounds nice. You can make some dope
  wallpapers from it, or just sit and ponder the orb. Was an experiment in using
  bitwise XOR shader to make something that is neither intense nor ugly colored,
  grew a bit too big for my shader collection project.
  .
  Ladybug Window:
  .
  This autumn, on warm sunny days ladybugs would come and chill on my window at
  sunset. They were very calm and i enjoyed their presence. This vignette attempts
  to capture the vibe of those evenings for you and future me to enjoy.
  .
  Games fast:
  .
  I make a lot of small things from scratch all the time. This taught me some
  stuff. Wrote a condensed 3 page thing about how to make small things really
  fast. Idk if it's good advice, so don't be too mad if it doesn't work.
  .
  Desktop Incense Burner:
  .
  Love watching the incense smoke, it's got good vibes. I like things with good
  vibes, so i made a vignette that recreates that. Burns in real time, stick runs
  out after 10 ish minutes, relaunch application to reset it.
  .
  The pricing & its history:
  .
  In the spirit of doing weird wacky things for their own sake, as with the rest
  of the pack, the pricing was also wacky and utilized the Fibonacci sequence
  pricing (patent pending). It sold 16 numbered copies, each more expensive than
  the last, with #1 selling for 0.01$ and #16 selling for 9.87$
  .
  Nobody bought a new copy of the bundle for over 2 months as of 1650239400 and I
  don't expect that to change. This made me think that doing the following 2
  things would be funny:
  .
  release the project files under this funky license
  .
  remove the ability to buy this project*
  .
  *you can probably find a way to get the files from another person or the
  internet
  .
  Special thanks to Brin who made this page pretty

  WHAT IS 9 TILL VOID?
  .
  9 Till Void is a turn-based deckbuilding roguelike that features neither deck

  the source of darkness and destroy it from within.
  .
  POSITIONAL SPELL SLINGING
  .
  9 Till Void is played on a 9x9 grid, where each row correlates with one of your
  spell slots. You can only cast a spell if your character occupies the same row
  on the board as the spell, so your position always matters.
  .
  ASSEMBLE AN ARSENAL OF DEADLY SPELLS
  .
  Buy new spells to become more powerful! Where you choose to place your spell is
  just as important as what spell you choose to buy! If you place the spell in the
  topmost spell slot, you'll only be able to cast that spell at the top of the
  level.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  72 Different Spells
  .
  5 Playable Characters, each with a unique ability and starting spell
  .
  5 Locations, each with unique spells and enemies to discover

  start runs from any of the 5 locations with pre-chosen spells. Custom mode is
  perfect for test driving spell combinations without having to hope for perfect
  RNG.

developer: ebi-hime
publisher: ebi-hime
genre: Visual Novel
description:
  Set fifteen minutes into the future, AIdol is about a new craze that's been
  sweeping Japan: virtual idols.
  .
  Virtual idols look like normal humans, but they're made of wire and circuitry.
  They can sing better, dance better, and entertain better than any human could
  ever hope to, and their devotion to their jobs is unfailing.
  .
  The protagonist, Hana, is a young high school student who loves virtual idols -
  particularly Aiko. Aiko is the postergirl of the famous company Lyriq, and one
  of the most popular virtual idols to ever exist. Aiko is the nation's darling,
  and though Hana adores her, she knows she'll never get a chance to speak to her.
  Aiko is simply too far out of her reach.
  .
  That is, until one day, when somebody claiming to be Aiko starts sending Hana
  text messages asking for help. Aiko tells Hana that she's in severe danger of
  malfunctioning, and the only person who can save her is her original
  programmer... but nobody seems to know where they are, and nobody is willing to
  help her.
  .
  Left with no alternatives, it's up to Hana (and an eclectic cast of characters
  she meets along the way) to save Aiko from being turned into scrap metal!
  .
  A sweet, family-friendly story about making friends, going on adventures, and
  the power of music!
  .
  Written by ebi-hime, the author of Strawberry Vinegar and Blackberry Honey
  .
  A large cast of adorable characters drawn by Melowbee, the artist behind
  Windswept Night

game: Above - The Fallen (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/A/Above - The Fallen (USA)/Above - The Fallen (USA).json
developer: Hexnite
publisher: Hexnite
genre: Platformer
description:
  Above: The Fallen is a 2D side-scrolling, puzzle - platformer game that is
  centered around travelling upwards instead of to the left or right. The goal is
  to climb the trees of an ancient and mystical forest in order to break through
  the canopy. You must manipulate two main characters at the same time throughout
  the game, solve puzzles, and avoid the hazards of this dark forest.
  .
  Mankind has been driven from their homes among the trees by the Night King, a
  nightmarish beast whose origin has been lost to time. Now, man lives in the
  dirt, fearing the moments the Night King leaves his roost to prey upon their
  vulnerable forms.
  .
  Every generation the elders send a young couple out into the world to find a new
  home for their people where they need not fear the relentless hunger of the
  Night King. Every generation these journeys have failed. This time however, the
  young couple has decided to ascend into the trees and reclaim their ancestral
  home instead of fleeing into the darkness. Can they rise above?
  .
  Controlling 2 Characters with 1 GamePad
  .
  In Above: The Fallen, you play as both the male and female characters at the
  same time (Single Player Mode Only). They often find themselves in situations
  that require them to work together to solve puzzles and progress up to the
  canopy. Each character is controlled with one half of the Gamepad. This offers
  an additional challenge and requires you to think about each character's
  positioning before moving. If you don't get the hang of it right away, don't
  worry, it won't be long before you're climbing through the jungle like Tarzan.
  .
  Single Player or Co-op mode!
  .
  Bring a friend along with you as you adventure through the world, solve puzzles
  and work together to defeat the Night King. Swap back and forth easily from
  single player to co-op with a push of a button.
  .
  Vertical Scrolling / Climbing
  .
  Climbing is essential to the goal of reaching the forest's canopy. This differs
  from traditional side-scrollers where you generally move in a straight line
  throughout the world.
  .
  Puzzles
  .
  There are many interesting puzzles that you'll come across as you play. Some
  puzzles are solvable in multiple ways which allows for some freedom to explore.
  Each successfully completed puzzle brings you closer to facing the Night King!
  .
  Skills
  .
  As you progress through the world you'll come across shrines that when
  activated, interact with your amulet, and unlock ancient magic hidden away from
  humanity. The character's will then receive a new skill which will be needed to
  complete upcoming puzzles.
  .
  Enemies
  .
  There are many animals to watch out for while exploring the forest. Use caution
  while approaching them though, they don't like being disturbed.

  on display in a museum, but if you have one that doesn't run it, you have my
  deepest sympathy.
  .
  Just to be safe, you should have at least the below specs. But to be 100% safe,
  download the demo first and check if it runs ok before making any purchase.
  .
  OS: Windows 7+ / OS X 10.9+
  .
  Processr: 1.5 Ghz
  .
  Memory: 2 GB RAM
  .
  Storage: 200 MB disk space
  .
  Video card: 512 MB, DirectX 9.0c
  .
  Keyboard or gamepad
  .
  Heads up!
  .
  The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated
  machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines
  and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind
  you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any
  fear of missing out on game content.
  .
  Please download and play the demo before making a purchase!
  .
  I don't want to mislead anyone into spending money on the game. That's why I
  made this demo version, so you can try it and see for yourself if you like it
  and if it works properly on your machine. And only then buy the game, if you
  consider it's worth your money.
  .
  Thank you for your support!

genre: Strategy;Simulation
description:
  In Airships: Conquer the Skies you'll need to use all of your creativity and
  skill to design and build fearsome airships and land vehicles to give you the
  edge in massive aerial battles.
  .
  Construct your vehicles by piecing together a vast array of modules, choosing
  weapons, armour types, structures, equipment and resources in near endless
  configurations to allow you to prevail against even the toughest foes.
  .
  The vehicles are highly detailed, teeming with sailors moving around performing
  their individual tasks to stay in the fight. Your choices of vehicle layouts are
  crucial, exploring the design space of different crafts and their matching
  tactics to make sure your fleet emerges victorious.
  .
  Once your vehicles are ready for the fight, you'll give high-level commands to
  your small fleet, swooping, soaring, ramming and boarding others to gain the
  upper hand in battle. Ships and terrain are fully destructible: they can catch
  fire, explode, break apart, and fall, so you'll need to choose your tactics
  wisely.
  .
  Face off against giant aerial kraken, fleshcracker mechs, huge venomous spiders,
  clockwork wasps, and more. Defeat them and reap the rewards.
  .
  Play across three distinctly different modes: taking on (or creating your own)
  bespoke Missions; building a mighty empire in Conquest, or destroying your
  friends in Multiplayer matches online or via LAN.

  job and just spend his life inside an All-you-can-eat diner.
  .
  As years go by, his freeloading nature becomes legend, but then a tragedy occurs
  - the diner is about to close down! Will our hero finally settle down and get a
  regular job?
  .
  Never!!!
  .
  Embark on an epic quest filled with humor, puns and controversy as you traverse
  the city in search of a solution to your life's problems.
  .
  Memorable characters include yourself, your dad who is also your only friend, a
  very foxy secretary love interest (but that just doesn't work out... at all),
  and half a dozen more
  .
  The plot takes a dark turn when the CEO of a Megaslimy corporation and the Mayor
  of whatever team up to do some evil.
  .
  Can you stop them and more importantly - do you even care?
  .
  Gameplay
  .
  All You Can Eat is a unique interactive comic that blends the mechanics of
  .
  playing a game seamlessly with the experience of reading a comic:
  .
  every interaction in the game world (such as talking, picking up items, using
  objects etc.) creates a new comic panel, furthering the story
  .
  at any time during the game you can scroll up and down to read what you've
  created among hundreds of unique hand-drawn (and hand-scanned!) content rich
  panels
  .
  the in-game conversations mimic the "3 panel structure" of daily comics with
  context, setup and delivery
  .
  when the player ends the game, he is given the option to print out his gameplay
  in a comic book format
  .
  a new game+ option with a developer commentary track when you finish the game

  Features:

  Enhanced Visuals!

  superior second game's engine." Trust us, it feels better.
  .
  Improved level design and difficulty options!
  .
  Both games are infamously hard-as-nails, but Normal and Easy difficulties come
  with infinite lives, so take as many attempts as you need to beat the challenge.
  Level designs have been improved upon to really nail the balance between tough
  and fair. Or perhaps you loved the limited lives and ludicrous overuse of
  instant-death blocks in the original release? We've got you covered. Just select
  "Old School" or higher from the difficulty menu and you'll be cursing the
  developers' name in no time.

  Quality of Life Improvements!

  Faster respawning (When you die, which will be often, you'll just pop right back
  out of the Toaster and get on with your day, just like nature intended!),
  multiple save slots, accessibility options and more mean that anybody can take
  on the challenge.

  New Chapter, Completing The Story!

  more of it now! Beat both games to unlock the epic finale!

  villages and moody, rain-drizzled night scenes. This is another one of those
  games I've flicked through the screenshots as if it were a global travel book
  outlining places you should visit before you die." - Chris Priestman, Indie
  Statik
  .
  "The game's sound design is the strongest facilitator of Anodyne's sense of
  dread and unease; the ambience and music give off an air of suspicion and
  danger, with ugly chords and disquieting, unnatural-sounding synthetic pings. It
  all adds up to a game where you're not sure who to trust, and you can't be sure
  of what's real." - Sam Prell, Penny Arcade Report
  .
  Please Note
  .
  The Mac version has flickering on fullscreen on some version of Mac OSX. Please
  play in windowed mode.
  .
  Linux: Anodyne does not have an official Linux version, buy at your own risk -
  This is unsupported, a very old (but complete) version from 2013 or so. I cannot
  help you with any bugs for this version. You can try to get the executable
  working, or you can play the standalone SWF.
  .
  Content Warnings (Light spoilers)
  .
  Low-res pixel art (like in the style of the screenshots of): Suicide by hanging,
  mild horror, murder by blunt objects, dead bodies, stabbing, blood stains,
  mentions of sex, unexpected killing of an NPC. Rare strong language. Note this
  isn't representative of the majority of the game, but it is unavoidable.
  .
  Content Warnings (Spoilers)
  .
  Early on, if you try to talk to a fisherman, when trying to talk, you will
  unexpectedly hit them into the ocean and it turns the water red. They're implied
  to die.
  .
  In the late-game black/white suburb area: suicide by hanging, murder by blunt
  objects, stabbing, blood stains, dead bodies, mild horror
  .
  In the late-game 8-bit pixel art maze: blood stains, dead bodies
  .
  In the late-game circus area: mentions of suicide, suicide by falling into a
  pit, dead bodies, blood stains
  .
  In the very-late-game golden garden area: mentions of sex
  .
  Throughout: rare strong language

game: Anomalies (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/A/Anomalies (USA)/Anomalies (USA).json
developer: Schmidt Workshops
publisher: Schmidt Workshops
genre: Simulation
description:
  Anomalies may be a game, then again it may not. One user described it as "A
  million musical leeches, waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain."
  .
  Another said "I don't even know what to say about this one. It honestly freaked
  me out a little."
  .
  A particularly enthusiastic user stated "Wish I had some kind of supercomputer
  to push the limits on this thing... I'm pretty sure it would reveal the secrets
  of the universe."
  .
  A Fine Art Game
  .
  Anomalies is an experimental generative art game. There are no levels, points or
  objectives. It is a "game" in the loosest sense of being an amusement or
  pastime, an interactive piece of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can
  tinker around with and explore.
  .
  Generate and Explore
  .
  You can randomly generate the anomalies, or you can change the anomaly's
  parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your
  creation. Use the controls to explore Anomalies, and the unique sights and
  sounds they generate.
  .
  Sights and Sounds
  .
  Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one
  effect the other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are
  symmetrical and harmonious. All the images and "songs" you hear in the demo
  video were produced through the program's algorithms.
  .
  Other Options
  .
  Using a built in screen capture button, you can collect snapshots of your
  handiwork. Use it as desktop wallpaper, or share it with your friends. If you
  want to revisit a favorite anomaly, you can also save it and load it again
  later. There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies
  automatically, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show.
  .
  Experimental
  .
  I call Anomalies "experimental" because of the way in which I developed it. I
  started with a simple idea - "what would trees look like if they grew in space?"
  - and began to create fairly simple, branching structures. Once that was
  working, I thought about different colors and textures. Each stage brought new
  questions and possibilities - "what if they move or wiggle? What it they make
  sounds? What if they produce flames or particles?" - and so on, until I arrived
  at what you see in the program. So I had no idea what it would end up like when
  I started it. Though I have moved on to other projects, I still think about more
  possibilities for Anomalies. I do hope to be able to return to working on this
  program at some point, but I will not give any promises right now...
  .
  Moddable Anomalies
  .
  If you want to change things around, add your own sound effects, swap out
  textures etc... download the "Anomalies_Moddable.zip" and have at it!
  .
  For Backgrounds, the game looks at the following files:
  .
  Space_Background_006.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_007.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_008.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_009.bmp
  .
  Space_Background_010.bmp
  .
  There are a few other background styles in there already.  If you rename them to
  one of these (6-10) then they will appear in-game, if the background slider is
  set to the appropriate number.  For whatever reason, 0 and 1 both correspond to
  "Space_Background_006.bmp", 2 to 007, 3 to 008, 4 to 009 and 5 to 010.  It's not
  particularly logical, but it works :)

  This game can be played either with a keyboard or a game controller! There can

  the arrows, or WASD, or the left stick of a controller, or the D-pad to move

  [X] or (A) to use the laser-beam

  [C] or (B) to use the bomb

  unlocked some upgrades, you can select unlocked upgrades by pressing down
  instead of confirming the [restore file] prompt. We're sorry we didn't manage to
  communicate this better in-game, we'll do better next time!

  Explore the ruins of the human race and discover the thriving wildlife that
  blossomed after our extinction in this underwater action/adventure. Encounter
  monstrous creatures and let curiosity guide you through an inevitable voyage of
  extinction.
  .
  The water rose by an unpredictable amount due to climate change. The sun started
  losing power and the Earth's surface froze over. Humans were forced to live
  underwater, where they could still harvest energy and grow food, changing how
  cities and districts looked. As resources began to dwindle in the year 2971,
  sub-aquatic spaceships were sent to a nearby wormhole to look for habitable
  planets. Things did not go as planned, as the ship, Argo9, returns millions of
  years later in a time humans have gone extinct.
  .
  It will be up to the player to determine if the ruins of our species is a
  travesty or an inevitable conclusion as they explore the waters and encounter
  deadly underwater monsters.
  .
  Controls: movement WASD || shooting/aim = LMB/mouse || Change weapon =
  Scroll/"Q" & "E"/Numb keys or you can use a gamepad (xbox controller
  recommended).
  .
  So this is our first big game! We haven't made a big game before so it's really
  exciting to make something of this scale, but also a bit like just being two
  people wrestling a colossus. Much like in Shadow of the Colossus. This is
  something we really want to make as great as possible so we're taking our time
  and working loads on it, full time like.

  A collection of games I wrote over the years in Java with their full sources.
  Some are rather complex games, and I tried to complete them to a playable state
  (Sea Wars being the most complex), some simpler (Similar, my 2nd applet game
  from 2006).
  .
  SeaWars is a relatively complete 2D strategic game that play on maps: a global
  strategic map and a zoomed tactical map. On the strategic map you play as you
  want, with only events that you can avoid without penalties (in this version).
  But you don't see the enemies, or your civil ships. On the tactical map you
  fight. You see the enemies only if they are damaged, otherwise you need to
  detect them. If too far you might not know if they are in your camp or not.
  .
  It's a simple game on some aspects, but complex on some others. For instance
  missiles and torpedoes can follow waypoints then seek for a target.
  .
  It became a bit too much for one person, so I finally "fixed" the gameplay this
  year, adding full save, separation of surface units and submarine (by default
  you will command surface unit, but you can manually decide), addition of civil
  unit and many small changes and fixes.
  .
  And it would be the ideal game to mod, complement, or use as a base for other
  game: use some algorithms or ideas within another game.
  .
  Draw was SeaWars. I accidentally discovered that the tactical map of Sea Wars
  could do very cool effects. Draw was born. The engine below is the same, the
  elements you see are still missiles and torpedoes, and they think they are in a
  naval game :). It's the most polished "game" here, and was finished around 2009,
  with only additions since then, and an automatic throttle system: the number of
  elements allowed changes depending on the FPS. But it's also one with many parts
  remaining from SeaWars. I kept them "in case". One of the latest addition was to
  reintegrate a SeaWars mechanism...
  .
  Similar is the oldest game. Based on a Palm Pilot game (for whose old enough to
  remember), it was aimed at being a very light online game. And it is. Using pure
  Java graphics systems, it is also suffering for that. It is still enjoyable, and
  had some good success when it was on the web (>10.000 players), but would
  greatly benefit from a remake. The score are not saved anymore, as I chose to
  keep the ghost code that was saving in a distant MySQL server (
  DBSupport.addScore(playerName.toString(), score, nbColors, sizeGrid); ). Feel
  free to add a local DB support, or a modern score system. I will add any change
  to the code!
  .
  All my code is released under MIT licence, so you are free to do whatever you
  want with it. The games are mostly easy to change, up to a point - some parts
  might not be so simple - so can be modified by children, with a little help.
  Feel free to share new creations or modifications. If you contact me I will be
  happy to share them as part of the pack here!
  .
  All the games were originally Applets, so POJO without many dependencies. They
  can be compiled and run within Eclipse or another IDE very easily.
  .
  The current pack is ready to run on Windows, but it should be relatively easy to
  run on Linux. If you can do a distribution for it simply contact me. I will help
  you do that and give you a free key.  A Mac version is on the work but could
  benefit from some help too!
  .
  All good modifications can be shared within the pack with the authors credited!
  Just be careful if you use API or assets for their respective licences. Be
  careful that GPL APIs cannot be used as this project is under a MIT licence,
  which allows commercial use without sharing source. LGPL APIs can be used if
  used as libs only (not part of the project's sources).
  .
  You can also fetch the code from the public repository: archive on BitBucket
  .
  Buying this pack will support creating more content such as that!
  .
  If you encounter any issue, please contact me. If you are a developer, feel free
  to look at the code! I will credit anybody that helps! :)

  the surface was hard. She spent most of it fighting for everything and

  doctor no one tries to stop him
  .
  Jude Myers
  .
  You can usually find him at the bar with Sam, the closest thing to
  .
  family he has left. Or in the greenhouse tending to the plants with loud

  grunge music from the 1990s shaking the walls. If you see him with any
  .
  tech, you should probably assume it's contraband and say nothing
  .
  Gloria Miller
  .
  The sweet Community Affairs Supervisor who wants to keep everyone's
  .
  spirits up in these dark times. Born in Camden she isn't fully aware of
  .

  Eva Turner
  .
  An overly friendly security officer full of charm, and a sad smile.

  She'll tackle criminals all day, and then sweep you into her arms and

  sing karaoke with you all night. Or she'll challenge you to a race, then
  .
  feel bad that she didn't let you win.

  .
  to medicine, if we can grow it then it's here. Never worry about fatal
  .
  power outages again. We use an advanced Geothermal energy system that is

  as safe as it is efficient. Our impressive security and medical

description:
  Asteroids... But Roguelite is a game about shooting enemy ships and (you guessed
  it) asteroids in order to increase your score. Your multiplier grows as you kill
  enemies and resets when you get hit. Visit the store after bosses in order to
  upgrade your ship and score higher.   Try to get a build going that can survive
  long enough to rack up a large multiplier in order to take your place on the
  leaderboard!
  .
  In between rounds, you can purchase various upgrades from the shop of which
  there are currently over 40 of.  You can also spend money on rolling different
  quests to undertake. Some quests just give you a bonus for defeating a set
  amount of enemies, some actually upgrade your abilities themselves. For example,
  there's a quest for killing 50 enemies with your laser to unlock a double laser.
  .
  And that's it!  Blow up enemies and asteroids, use your money to increase your
  power, and aim for a spot on the leaderboard.  Once you die, your run is over
  and you can start again.
  .
  I made this game in a little under four months. It's not my life's work, but I
  think it has a good amount of content for it's price point. I want to be clear
  with setting expectations that this isn't a 100 hour game, and it's priced
  accordingly. What you get is a high-score chasing shoot-em-up with multiple
  upgrade paths and quests to complete.  I've added a video of me playing for
  under 5 minute and defeating on of the randomized bosses.

  Play as Doctor Simon Forman - unlicensed medical professional and astrologer -
  and help him win a medical licence. Astrologaster is a narrative-based comedy
  game.
  .
  Explore Forman's life, his work, and his relationships with his clients. Make
  story choices by performing astrological readings. Choose strategically or make
  decisions just for fun - but be aware that your choices will have consequences
  (and unpredictable side effects!)
  .
  13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional
  and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and
  determine answers for your clients' problems. As well as affecting the
  storyline, these choices will alter your clients' satisfaction levels. Satisfied
  clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these
  letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge.
  .
  So-called real (licensed) doctors call Forman a quack and fraud. Help Forman
  prove these medical establishment elitists wrong!
  .
  Features
  .
  Perform real* astrology: Examine the sky and choose astrological interpretations
  that Forman will use to advise his patients. (But remember: astrology is not an
  exact science!)
  .
  Solve hilarious problems: Consult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror
  plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies!
  .
  Change lives: Win your patients' favour or ruin their lives. Advise 14
  characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which
  often overlap with each other. Use gossip from some characters to guide and
  manipulate others.
  .
  Win a medical licence: Convince patients to write letters of recommendations.
  Collect enough letters to exchange them for a medical licence.
  .
  Fully voiced character dialogue: Sitcom-style comedy brought to life by a cast
  of over a dozen actors.
  .
  Sing along: Enjoy Renaissance-era music and sing along to each character's theme
  song.
  .
  Casebooks come alive: Simon Forman's cases are presented as a beautiful pop-up
  book. Turn pages to delve deeper into your patients' stories.
  .
  The Story
  .
  London, 1592. A great plague sweeps through the capital. When doctors flee the
  city in fear, a hero rises. His name is Simon Forman, "Doctor" of Astrology,
  Astronomy and Physick. Not only does he have the power to cure the sick, he can
  find their lost pets and predict their futures! All by reading the movements of
  the stars.
  .
  But when the plague ends, Forman's problems begin. The real doctors return to
  London and they will stop at nothing to bring him down...
  .
  Summary
  .
  Astrologaster is a story-driven astrological comedy game set in Shakespeare's
  London. Based on a true - and truly ridiculous - story. Simon Forman was
  considered a sage by some and a charlatan by others. What will your legacy be?
  Will you put your faith in the stars?

  their hunters. Luck brought them to our backyard. They wanted help. They needed
  help. We didn't listen.

description:
  Welcome to a world trapped in perpetual fighting. Attrition is a turn-based
  strategy game where three countries, Lutem, Bertas, and Cualitas, are constantly
  at war with one-another. Command their armies in a story of opposite opinions,
  sacrifices for one's beliefs, and the quest for a greater goal. Here no one's
  completely in the wrong, but no one's completely in the right.
  .
  In the world of Attrition armies are simple, consisting only of troops armed
  with obsolete rifles, and not always having the capacity to move around with
  ease. A pair of dice controls how far an army can go, so commanders must adjust
  to every situation and get the most out of the terrain they're fighting in. Here
  the lucky have the advantage, but the better strategist comes out victorious.

description:
  More than a game, Autumn is a relaxing place for spiritual learning and growth
  with a soothing atmosphere.
  .
  In each game you play as a Spirit which depends on the natural world for its
  progress in life. As you help the world around you to thrive, you receive vital
  energy(Prana) in return. During the Autumn season, while the trees are shedding
  their leaves, orbs of Prana are released into the air, which you can absorb.
  Your own Prana can be utilized to help and change the world around you and to
  obtain spiritual teachings.
  .
  More than levels, puzzles or in-game progressions, Autumn's focus is on the
  growth of the player. Not the one in the game, but the one in the chair.
  .
  There are no time limits, no enemies to defeat, no goals to reach... except the
  ones you set for yourself. Relax, learn, grow... and enjoy Autumn.

  In this interactive sci-fi adventure novel, you are the AI pilot of Earth's last
  interstellar ship, tasked with finding a home for your crew-the last remnants of
  humanity. Your choices will determine their fate, and your own.
  .
  You are the AI in charge of Earth's final interstellar spaceship, tasked with
  delivering your human crew to a suitable new home among the stars. The fate of
  previous ships is unknown--with a set of galactic maps to guide you, it's your
  job to decide which planets to visit, which crew to send down to the surface,
  and which choices they should make along the way. You are humanity's last hope.
  .
  Your choice matters!
  .
  Each of ten possible crew members has a distinct set of attributes, traits and
  flaws that will impact your chances, so choose wisely! With over 30 planets and
  stations to visit, over 700 choices to make, and near-infinite randomized sector
  maps to visit, there are countless paths to take across the galaxy.
  .
  A novel's worth of adventure!
  .
  Over 120,000 words of text across multiple playthroughs provide a rich storyline
  full of action, suspense, drama and horror. Can you find your way down all four
  paths to victory?
  .
  Customizable
  .
  Lua-based missions and json-based data files make writing and scripting your own
  missions simple, and creating new characters is a breeze with the in-game
  character creator. Write yourself into the game, or include your friends and see
  who survives.
  .
  Eat your crew
  .
  Food and fuel are hard to come by in deep space. Choose wisely but quickly in
  charting your course--when supplies run out, tough decisions will be in store,
  and cannibalism might be the only option...

  Retro!
  .
  Remember the 'good old days' when you used to copy your favourite games onto a
  single cassette tape and produce your own hit compilation? ... No, I don't
  either, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm far too young.
  .
  Mix Tapes!
  .
  Cassettes? Erm... it's like a hard drive but a slower, bulkier, less convenient
  way of storing your games to play later. But it's fun, you see, because it's
  retro and physical and it makes satisfying noises when you press the buttons.
  .
  Short, sharp bursts of fun!
  .
  Awesome Mix Tape is a compilation of single mechanic games. Some might be fun,
  some might be challenging, some might be interesting prototypes that could
  become larger games. More games are added each month so keep us installed and
  regularly receive free updates with our latest micro game.
  .
  13 games and counting...
  .
  Puzzle shooters, dodge`emp-ups, a scary spot-the-difference, infection control,
  twists on classic games, mash-ups of genres, some that are barely a game but I
  thought looked nice.
  .
  AND there's more to come ...

description:
  They may be awkward dimensions, but they're my dreams...
  .
  Interactive Dream Journal & Diary; Awkward Dimensions Redux is a personal game.
  Lasts 20 minutes to an hour with less traditional interaction. Focuses on
  getting to understand another person through an interpretation of their dreams,
  thoughts, fears, desires, and past work. It's a game about conversing with
  roosters, disembodied legs, standardized tests, Immature jokes, relationships,
  art, espionage, and a teenager coming to terms with life and growing up.
  .
  Q & A
  .
  Why is the game so large in file size? Is there tons uncompressed audio or what?
  .
  It's a huge game, but I try my best to compress and optimize where I can. Most
  of it is probably lightmaps though.
  .
  What operating systems does it support?
  .
  Windows, Mac, and Linux. (with limited gamepad support)
  .
  Is this a sequel to this game?
  .
  No, it's a remastered and completely redone version of that original jam
  prototype.
  .
  I love the music in the game! Where can I get the soundtrack?
  .
  The music created originally for the game is here, but the other music is from
  musicians whom I've asked permission to use their work in my game and you can
  purchase their music on their bandcamp pages. And please do support them, they
  are amazing musicians! :)

  Congratulations!
  .
  You and your friends are graduating from the prestigious Intergalactic Time
  Academy. No time for partying though as your first mission awaits! The Orbees
  are all missing. Yes, those curious little beings made of energy who power our
  time-tech are nowhere to be fou... no, wait! We have a faint trace on their
  signal. Are you brave enough to rescue them?
  .
  Prepare yourself for unknown dangers. If you find some of the Orbees they might
  equip your Space-Time Machine with new tech. Decide who is in charge of each
  gadget and combine your abilities to discover the best strategies.
  .
  Use cunning, comradeship and co-operation to survive and never forget the
  Academy motto: "BFF or Die!"
  .
  Best Friends Forever
  .
  BFF or Die is a game for you if:
  .
  You want a 2-4 player game to play with your partner/family/friends where you
  get to do everything as a team.
  .
  Pure co-operation sounds fun to you as it's a different feeling when you all
  work together.
  .
  You like games that are easy to start playing but then gradually get more
  challenging.
  .
  You like games that let you figure things out yourself rather than "hand
  holding" you too much and telling you what to do.
  .
  You want a game with a fun, short campaign mode which adds replayability by
  having difficult trophies to collect and also an unlockable "Infinite" mode.
  .
  Is There Online Multiplayer?
  .
  We do not have native online multiplayer support... BUT... you *can* play with
  your friends online by using Parsec. Parsec (which is free to use) lets you
  share games with friends by streaming your screen and sound to them. Their
  inputs (control pad or keyboard commands) then get sent to you and with almost
  no lag (depending on your computer and internet). This let's you play real-time
  online co-op together..!
  .
  What to Expect
  .
  We strongly recommend playing in co-op 2, 3 or 4 player mode as this is when the
  game is most fun. Playtime will vary depending on your skill level but as a
  guide:
  .
  1-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  2-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  3-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  4-Player story game: 2-3 hours
  .
  "The Infinite Trials": 1-999 hours! Or maybe  hours :) Complete as many
  randomised/procedural levels in a row as you can without losing. Go back to the
  start if you die.
  .
  You can either share controllers (two people per controller) or have separate
  controllers. As a minimum you need the keyboard and one control pad to have a
  4-player game. Or you can use four separate control pads, it's up to you.
  .
  There's a story mode with 30 levels followed by an unlockable "Infinite Trials"
  mode with challenging randomised/procedural levels.
  .
  Is Your Computer Fast Enough?
  .
  If you have a dedicated graphics card and/or your computer can normally play 3D
  games then you should be able to run BFF or Die just fine.
  .
  If you have a high resolution screen (like with newer Macbooks) then you will
  probably want to set the bootup options of the game to 1920x1080 to get a smooth
  frame rate unless you also have a super fast graphics card to match your high
  screen resolution.
  .
  Info for Mac Users
  .
  Please note that because of changes Apple have made, the game won't launch on
  Mac OS Catalina and above.
  .
  New Game
  .
  Hey, Shaz here, the game designer - I'm working on a new co-op game called Co

  In Back to Bed you guide the sleepwalker Bob to the safety of his bed by taking
  control of his subconscious guardian named Subob. Together they will travel
  through a surreal and painting-like dream world, avoiding dangers and getting
  safely back to bed.
  .
  Back to Bed is an artistic 3D puzzle game with a surreal twist. It tells the
  story of Bob, an unlucky narcoleptic who has a tendency of falling asleep in his
  boring office and then proceeding to sleepwalk into the dangers of the big city.
  Luckily, Bob has a subconscious guardian named Subob, whom spawns from the mind
  of Bob and whose job it is to protect the sleepwalker from any danger and guide
  him back to the safety of his bed.
  .
  The ever vigilant Subob must guide the constantly sleepwalking Bob on a journey
  through a series of surreal painting-like cityscapes where the boundary between
  Bob's dreams and reality have vanished, as Subob is part of Bob's
  subconsciousness. The result is an artistic dream world that is recognizable,
  yet totally different from the real world, where many things are not what they
  seem and dangers to the sleepwalker lurks deeper in. Key features
  .
  Unique surreal and artistic game universe

  A strange but beautiful dream universe that mixes elements from the real world
  and the world of dreams to create something unique, surreal and sometimes a bit

  must manipulate the strange environment to create a safe path for Bob and avoid
  the dangers of the puzzle.

  trying to save its own sleepwalking body from dangers of the the dream world.

  Picturesque visual style

  visual style inspired by hand-painted techniques, surreal art and impossible
  shapes.

  puzzle solving skills and enjoy thinking many steps ahead, or who are just too
  stubborn to give up.

genre: Puzzle
description:
  You're not special. You're not a hero. Thrust into unfortunate circumstances,
  you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your
  biggest case yet.
  .
  There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective.
  .
  Backbone is a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard
  Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a
  deeply personal story of change and transformation.
  .
  Backbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern
  political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of
  Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and
  challenges your perception of what it means to be a person.
  .
  Backbone's gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression,
  featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as
  exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but
  defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you.
  .
  As Howard, you will:
  .
  Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of
  truth
  .
  Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of
  person you want to be
  .
  Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange,
  yet familiar version of Vancouver
  .
  Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss
  .
  Be a raccoon
  .
  Post-noir dystopia
  .
  Backbone's Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely
  without hope. It's a tale of a cold and uncaring world, interspersed with
  genuine connections and a bruised but undying drive to make a difference.
  Everyone wants to change the world, but not always for the better.
  .
  Stunning visuals
  .
  The breathtaking combination of high-resolution pixel art and 3D effects like
  dynamic lighting, pouring rain, volumetric fog and neon lights bring the
  sprawling City to life. Visit iconic Vancouver locations like Gastown, Granville
  and Fairmont Hotel, reimagined in a world now inhabited by anthropomorphic
  animals.
  .
  Evocative and unforgettable soundtrack
  .
  Original doom jazz soundtrack by Danshin and Arooj Aftab features an innovative
  combination of classic jazz and electronic music. Backbone's OST is expertly
  crafted to create a cinematic, atmospheric, and simply jaw-dropping soundscape
  that serves and enhances storytelling.
  .
  Mature content
  .
  Backbone heavily features strong language, themes of violence, systemic racism
  and sexism, drug abuse, depression, terminal illness, body horror, death. All
  imagery is suggestive and not direct, but we would still never recommend this
  game to children.

game: Baldi's Basics Plus (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/B/Baldi's Basics Plus (USA)/Baldi's Basics Plus (USA).json
developer: Basically Games
publisher: Basically Games
genre: Edutainment;Horror
description:
  Baldi's Basics Plus version 0.3 has just released!
  .
  Check below for more info on the current state of the game!
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus is like the original game, but PLUS! The same cruddy
  edutainment horror type parody theme is back, but with hugely expanded gameplay
  features, including procedurally generated levels, field trip minigames, crazy
  random events, PLUS more characters, more items, and more chaos!
  .
  This game is not what it seems...
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus is a survival horror roguelite that parodies cheap 90's
  edutainment and never takes itself too seriously. You will encounter strange
  characters, find useful items, go on field trips and more as you explore Baldi's
  ever changing super schoolhouse, and as you explore the game itself, you'll
  start to realize it is not what it seems...
  .
  So, what exactly do you do in this game? You collect notebooks while playing
  hide and seek with Baldi! Sounds easy right? Wrong. Baldi can hear many of your
  actions, and he uses those sounds to try and find you. He's also invited many
  friends to come and play, who can cause a lot of trouble. Get to know them
  though and you can use them to your advantage! You'll also find lots of items
  scattered around the school. These are the key to success. Use them wisely if
  you want to have a chance at beating Baldi!
  .
  Near infinite replayability
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus randomizes so many different things, every time you play
  will be a different experience!
  .
  Procedurally generated levels - The levels change every time you play! Not only
  will the layout change, but the types of rooms and obstacles, you find will
  change too!
  .
  Random events - One moment everything is fine, the next the school is flooding,
  or fills with fog! Random events can begin at any moment, so make sure you're
  ready for them!
  .
  Mixing and matching characters - Each time you play, you'll get to see random
  combination of characters.
  .
  All these variables add up to make each playthrough a unique experience!
  .
  Lots of ways to play
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus features many different modes to test players in different
  ways!
  .
  Main Mode - Complete a series of randomly generated levels to win! Run out of
  lives and you'll have to start over.
  .
  Endless Mode - See how many notebooks you can collect before being caught by
  Baldi! Compete by playing on pre-made levels, or go crazy and try playing on a
  randomly generated one.
  .
  Challenge Mode - As you play more of the Main Mode, you'll unlock challenges!
  Challenges offer unique scenarios you won't find in the main game. One might
  have you sneaking around the school to avoid being seen by the Principal of the
  Thing, another might have both you and Baldi running at super high speeds!
  .
  Field Trips Mode - Play field trips found in the main game whenever you like!
  You can try to set high scores, or just practice!
  .
  Early access info
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus is going to launch this spring as an early access title.
  This means you will be able to buy and play the game, but it won't be finished
  yet! As such you can expect to encounter some bugs, and there will be some
  missing features for a while. However, you will also receive all future updates
  for free and get to be a part of this game's development! Check out the FAQ
  below for more info.
  .
  Why Early Access?
  .
  Baldi's Basics Plus has become a much longer project than I initially
  anticipated (That's game development for you!). However, I feel like it has
  reached a very playable and enjoyable state, so instead of making everyone wait
  who knows how long to be able to play, I've decided to release the game in early
  access so everyone can enjoy it sooner and take part in the development process!
  .
  Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
  .
  Currently, I'm thinking the game will probably be in development for another
  year or two until it reaches a state where I could call it finished.
  .
  How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version?
  .
  The full version will differ mainly by having more content. More NPCs, more
  random events, more items, more level styles, more everything! Of course, the
  full version won't just be the early access with more content. As the game
  develops there will be lots of polishing, QoL improvements, new major features
  added, etc. Perhaps most importantly, adjustments to game balance will mostly be
  done when the early access is coming to a close. The full version will also
  include some secrets and story elements that will not be found in the early
  access versions.
  .
  What is the current state of the Early Access version?
  .
  Keep an eye on this list as development progresses to see what's being added!
  .
  Features that are currently implemented include:
  .
  Hide and Seek (The game's main mode), which requires the player to beat a series
  of randomly generated levels. (Currently has three levels to beat, more are
  planned)
  .
  Challenge Mode (Currently there are three challenge maps, more are planned)
  .
  Endless Mode
  .
  Field trip Mode
  .
  Custom NPC AI (Currently there are 12 fully functional NPCs, more are planned)
  .
  Procedural level generation
  .
  Random events (Currently there are seven, more are planned)
  .
  Field trips (Currently there are two, more are planned)
  .
  "Educational" activities, which are very short puzzles or mini-games that must
  be completed to collect notebooks in some modes (Currently there is one, more
  are planned).
  .
  Custom lighting system
  .
  In-game shop where you can purchase items between levels
  .
  Save and continue system, which will allow you to quit in the middle of a game
  of Hide and Seek and then continue later where you left off
  .
  Planned features that are not yet implemented include:
  .
  Secret levels
  .
  In-game achievement system.
  .
  Horror elements (This will come much later into development. Currently the game
  has very little in the way of spooks)
  .
  Crappy "edutainment" elements, including things like more interactive menus
  (Where you can click on things!) and other common edutainment game tropes.
  .
  Adaptive music
  .
  Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?
  .
  Yes, as the game develops and more content is added, the price will increase
  accordingly. Of course, anyone who has already purchased the game will continue
  to receive all updates for free, even after price increases.
  .
  How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process?
  .
  Feedback is crucial to the development of this insane game! I will mainly use
  community feedback for fixing bugs, as well as balancing and quality of life
  improvements.

  Balloonys girlfriend got swept away by a strong gust of wind. Travel through 80
  screens of spikes, traps, and pooping birds to save her.
  .
  Gameplay is inspired by the game Bubble Ghost, an old favourite of mine and
  although fans of Bubble ghost will see that gameplay is very different at the
  same time there is not much else to compare Balloonys adventure to.
  .
  Left click anywhere on the screen and Balloony will turn to face that direction,
  then Right click and he will fly off in the selected direction bouncing off of
  walls and generally being hard to control. Watch out for spikes, lava and other
  miscellaneous traps as you bounce your way through eighty screens of balloon
  popping mayhem.

developer: onemrbean
publisher: onemrbean
genre: Sports
description:
  BasketBelle is an experimental 2D basketball-based platformer. Each Chapter of
  the game uses the mechanics and idea of basketball in a different way. At one
  point you might be dribbling inside the intestines of a purple blob creature. At
  others, you're likely to be dunking above the clouds in front of the Parisian
  moon.
  .
  A dynamic soundtrack and unique cardboard visuals help tell the story of a
  sister who must be saved through the power of basketball.
  .
  Dunk, dribble, and crossover through 8 Chapters spanning throughout the
  impromptu courts of Paris
  .
  Each Chapter takes the mechanics of basketball and applies them in different
  ways. Some chapters are more action, some are more puzzle. And then there are
  the strange chapters.
  .
  Music is tied directly to the gameplay, though it's all passively controlled.
  For example, every time you dribble, you hear a bass hit. Shoot the ball, and
  the percussion stops.
  .
  Visuals in the game are a unique mix of cardboard and color, every scene popping
  off the screen.
  .
  Included with the game! :D

  Reviews
  .
  "If you like Metroidvanias, you should play this game. If you don't like
  Metroidvanias, you should still play this game."
  .
  92/100 - COGconnected
  .
  "From the lushly drawn environments and detailed character sprites to the
  phenomenally atmospheric music that brings the game's world to life, it's a hell
  of an experience and easily one of my favorite indie games of 2020."
  .
  4.5/5 - HeyPoorPlayer
  .
  "A wonderfully crafted Metroidvania that should have genre fans plenty excited.
  It's blending of combat, platforming, and puzzling keeps the gameplay fresh and
  varied throughout its entire 20-hour story."
  .
  85/100 - PC invasion
  .
  Change Pip's elemental aura to block bullets of the opposite element!
  .
  Key Features
  .
  Gain new skills for your barbarian and elemental powers for Pip, the (magic)
  bat!
  .
  A narrative-driven metroidvania with dialogue choices and plenty of humor and
  snark.
  .
  Big numbers! 400+ rooms, 20+ hours of evolving gameplay, 10+ bosses, 60+ minutes
  of music and almost 30,000 words of text that a barbarian would never bother to
  read!
  .
  Puzzles.
  .
  RPG elements with a level-up minigame.
  .
  Contains more fruit throwing than probably any other game.
  .
  Companions that join you in your quest and help you out in fights.
  .
  Multiple endings based on your choices and actions.
  .
  The thrown fruit are NOT wasted, they are eaten by the bat (who is magic).
  .
  A ton of secrets and hidden loot just about everywhere.
  .
  The (magic) bat has a whopping FIVE different squeaking sounds!
  .
  Fewer repetitive jokes than this description has.
  .
  A controller is recommended for an optimal experience.
  .
  Batbarian: Testament of the Primordial is also available for Switch.

game: Beacon (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/B/Beacon (USA)/Beacon (USA).json
developer: monothetic
publisher: monothetic
genre: Action
description:
  In Beacon you play as interstellar mercenary Freja Akiyama, stuck in an endless
  search for her distress beacon after crash landing onto an unknown planet. With
  your Clone Bay stuck in an automatic printing cycle, death is only a minor
  setback. Each life you'll not only scavenge for weapons and items to help you;
  you'll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. After your inevitable
  death you're given the opportunity to alter your genome, allowing you to change
  your statistics and gain gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next
  clone's life.
  .
  In the search for your Beacon, new questions arise; just how many clones of
  Freja are there? How long has she been stuck in an infinite cycle of survival?
  How much of her humanity will be sacrificed before escaping?
  .
  A Rich Multi-Faction World to Scavenge -- Enter at the Kovus Outlands, fight
  your way through the Overgrown Spires, and push through the pollution to the
  cryptic Omega Vault where your Beacon is being held. Collect mementos to
  discover the mysteries behind the 5 Factions on Kovus-18, find Tinkered Weapon
  Variants left behind by previous clones, and track your secrets discovered at
  the end of each level.
  .
  100+ Mutations and 5 DNA Types -- Collect DNA from deceased enemies and alter
  your statistics after death. Gain new abilities with each new clone and alter
  your character into something not quite human.
  .
  300+ Items Spread Across 5 Item Types -- Find your favorite arsenal from unique
  technologies spread across the various factions. Regain an advantage with one
  time use Pickups, activate your reusable Auxiliary, swap your Grenade Mod, stock
  up on Passive Mods, and choose your 2 favorite Weapons.
  .
  100+ Enemies with Champion Variants -- The varied factions that inhabit Kovus-18
  will fight each other as well as you, including hybrid Minibosses that mix
  together the abilities of multiple factions.
  .
  15+ Boss Fights -- Face off against the ultimate lifeforms of each faction
  including the Solus Hivemind, Prism Mainframe, and Tritoraptor Matriarch.
  .
  DNA is the core of Beacon's gameplay loop. Through the use of Freja's state-of-
  the-art Clone Bay and DNA dropped by deceased enemies, after death you're given
  the opportunity to alter your genetic makeup and change your statistics before
  your fresh clone is 'printed' back at the crash site. Each faction has their own
  set of unique DNA and Mutations, allowing you to become a battle-hardened mass
  of metal, a luminous abomination of insect flesh, or anything in between!
  .
  The planet you've crashed on is unfamiliar. The only information available is
  its name - Kovus-18. The rest of the record is blank. It seems that either
  nothing is known about it, or whatever was known has been scrubbed from the
  database. Multiple factions populate its surface, each seemingly at war with the
  others, and all of them hostile to the planet's newest inhabitant... you.
  .
  Having grown up in the backwaters of civilised space, Freja always dreamed of
  adventure. Enrolling in the military at a young age she quickly discovered both
  her natural abilities for combat and piloting spacecraft, and her inability to
  work within the strict regimen of the armed forces. Freja lives and works aboard
  her ship the Ouroboros - a single-berth, heavily-modified light spacecraft that
  boasts state-of-the-art weaponry and facilities.

  .
  "Eight years in the making, Philip Bak's debut project is a twin stick shooter
  in which chaotic genius can be found." - Simon Parkin, Eurogamer
  .
  "The link between Bezier and Asteroids is more than simple coincidence. The game
  is evidently inspired by the Atari classic, even containing its own white-
  outlined chunks of space rock that subdivide when shot by the player. Unlike
  Asteroids, however, blasting Bezier's meteoroids will release a triangular
  'Firefly', which follows and fights alongside the player. In this and a dozen
  other ways Bezier elevates Atari's initial concept, transforming that elegantly
  spartan shoot 'em up into a thrilling kaleidoscope of breathless mayhem." - Rick
  Lane, Bit-Tech
  .
  "It's a hectic twin-stick shooter that has effortlessly swallowed my entire
  morning, and is probably going to eat up most of the evening too." - Christian
  Donlan, Eurogamer
  .
  "Bezier is a shiny twin-stick shooter, complete with all the explosions and
  mayhem that entails, and it's very good at that. What it adds on top of that is
  a story told only in snippets at the beginning of each stage. At least, to start
  with. When it starts reinforcing the story through gameplay, the cruelty of the
  villain becomes more than just words." - Lena LeRay, Indie Games
  .
  "It all makes for a captivating, unique and slightly unhinged experience. And I
  love it so very much." - Rob Fearon, Retro Remakes
  .
  "The soundtrack itself is worthy of praise. I paid the extra few dollars in
  order to get it, even though I had no idea if it'd be any good, and I'm glad I
  did. It's phenomenal." - Tyler Selig, MediaDetour
  .
  "Bezier is a fast paced twin stick Geometry Wars-Style blaster full of varied
  enemy design, frantic gameplay and more visual flair than a burning Lamborghini
  filled with fireworks and glitter." - Calum Fraser, AlphaBetaGamer
  .
  "It's beautiful and more than a little wacky." - Ben Barrett, Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  Player Feedback
  .
  "Outstanding. Here's an example of a game that both quintessentially represents,
  as well as broadens its genre. If you enjoy dual stick shooters, this is
  unmissable." - Gabrienb @ Steam
  .
  "Gave the game a try. Just wanted to take a quick look as I didn't have enough
  time to really get into it. Felt like I wouldn't be able to stop playing unless
  the world ended. This game is awesome." - Germaximus @ Steam
  .
  "Great fun. I've been waiting for this game for ages and it doesn't disappoint.
  Very fast moving and addictive. There's no time to rest, there's enemies to
  kill!" - ash @ Steam
  .
  "Is it that good you ask?...why yes..yes it is. This may well be in the top 5
  twin sticks I've played and yes I've played alot over the past 35 years of
  gaming starting with Robotron at the age of 4." - Fishsticks @ Steam
  .
  "All I can say in the end is it reminds me of all those days I spent playing
  away on the machines at my granda's old arcade. That alone makes this wonderful
  for me." - GeT_JoYe @ Steam
  .
  "Gorgeous Neon effects hectic action and LOTS of enemies to take out followed by
  an epic soundtrack. If you like twin stick shooters like Geometry Wars you'll
  love this. I've only been playing for 1 hour (lol) at the time of typing this
  and I already know I'm going to get a lot of enjoyment here. Do I recommend it?
  I most certainly do :D 9/10" - TheEndlessVortex @ Steam
  .
  "Beautiful game with a fantastic soundtrack. I'm a sucker for twin-stick
  shooters and this tried to bring something different to the market with the
  story." - fnminman @ Steam
  .
  "Interesting twin stick shooter with slick graphics, fun, tough gameplay and
  great music." - mojoxrisen @ Steam Greenlight
  .
  "The game is really, really amazing - looks great, sounds great (soundtrack is
  on Bandcamp if you'd like to preview it) - loads of original ideas etc. Can't
  recommend this enough" - shrewdlogarithm @ Steam Greenlight
  .
  "I seen it for 30 sec and bought it and let me tell you is pretty amazing.. it
  brings an excitement games of this type do not have. Vote for this game I highly
  recommended. Music is pretty awesome too.. One of the best sound tracks I heard
  this year." - Knight-Crawler @ Steam Greenlight
  .
  "I bought it on Desura and I would buy it again on Steam to support the
  developer. This is unabashed old school gaming madness!" - jcaracc2003 @ Steam
  Greenlight
  .
  "Holy crap this game is great This is the twin stick shooter evolved Took a few
  minutes to get my head round it, but once I did - OMFG Beautiful art style,
  OUTSTANDING soundtrack and really tight gameplay - Love it to bits" - Midian808
  @ Desura
  .
  "Just played the demo. This game is bloody amazing! About to purchase..." -
  IronSoldier @ Eurogamer

  "A really fun and beautiful game, that you seem to have really well polished
  during your 6 years development process." - MrModeste @ Desura
  .
  "Read about this on Rock Paper Shotgun and had to check it out, and I'm very
  glad I did. Great looking, amazing music and quality voice work. I love the
  visual design." - alffly @ Desura

  "Holy crap this game is great. The soundtrack alone is enough to justify a
  download" - DYFE @ Desura

  The Blaster Is A Dying Heart
  .
  Bezier is a dual stick blaster set inside a vast computer built deep
  underground. The story traces the principal's escape from this "Noah's Ark" gone
  wrong. A simple shooter on the surface, the deeper narrative pulls in his
  relationship between evolution and god, family and love. These themes question
  his motives, force him to confront what is real and lead him to salvation.
  .
  Powered by the BezierSynth traditional rendering is renounced in favour of a
  fluid aesthetic guided by story elements, player interaction and the audio
  engine. An eighty minute soundtrack blends together orchestra, synthesizers and
  many ethnic instruments to drive the drama through fifteen zones. Almost one
  hundred different enemies, voice acting, reward based achievements and different
  game modes make Bezier the mindless blaster with a big heart.
  .

  .
  If you have any problems with Bezier then firstly, we're very sorry that has
  happened. It is certainly not supposed to. Secondly, please get in touch with us
  at hello@thalamusdigital.co.uk and we will do our best to sort that out.

  Accessible parallel gameplay, information gathering puzzle game where you must
  solve puzzles to prevent threats from bringing harm to Secret Government agency
  #1's specialized disguise source, Mr. Moustache's Moustache Emporium.
  .
  Vocally Driven Puzzle-Point and Click filled with clever dialogue,
  ridiculousness, general befuddlement, and lots and lots of moustaches. After
  catching wind of a sinister plot to destroy Mr. Moustache's Moustache Emporium,
  a lone savior sets out to defend the city's largest moustache provider!
  .
  By switching between radio channels (by selecting presets or typing in new ones
  you find), noting the enemy's movements, and piecing together the clues, you can
  unravel the plans of your foes and stop them! The project is aimed at being
  color-blind friendly and uses shades instead of color variations to indicate
  need of interaction. It is also non-hearing friendly as subtitles are provided
  throughout. We had aimed to include accessibility for the blind but ran out of
  time. The game is in fact playable by such a person but may require assistance
  for selecting channels and inputting responses. Future planned features includes
  keyboard as input for the game focusing on use of the numpad rather than the
  qwerty section of the keyboard for ease of use and possibly custom hardware for
  blind user interfaces.

  About Binaries
  .
  Test your skills and reflexes as you simultaneously guide two lovable(1) balls
  through over 100 controller-smashingly(2) tough platform challenges. Control
  both balls at exactly the same time as you try to avoid the death and danger
  that awaits their every move.
  .
  Oh, and there are jokes.(3)
  .
  (1) May not be lovable
  .
  (2) May not even be a word
  .
  (3) May not be funny
  .
  Features
  .
  Make your way through over 100 levels of fiendish puzzle solving and death-
  defying challenges.
  .
  Glutton for punishment? Replay levels against the clock to get the fastest time
  you can. Are you quick enough to get S rank on every level? (We're not.)
  .
  A funky adaptive music score that ramps up when you do well and chills out if
  you're stuck, to help you concentrate. It's like the game wants you to do well
  (while it's throwing spikes at you).
  .
  Choose your own route to completion through a non-linear map. Stuck on a super-
  tough stage? No worries! Just go and hone your skills on a different level.
  .
  Laugh along with up to ten jokes! Look, we're going to keep saying it's funny.
  You'll come around eventually. (Don't worry there is no extra charge if you
  laugh more than ten times.)

description:
  1983. North East Scotland. An engineer is sent to an abandoned, clandestine
  research facility and is tasked with decommissioning equipment and gathering
  research material left by scientists. As the engineer travels deeper into the
  void, they are thrust into an unstable world of phantasmagorical horrors.
  .
  "There are so many neat touches, like the occasional shift to Resident Evil-
  style fixed cameras, the surreal, distorted dream sequences, and the fuzzy
  videos that use old science stock footage to creepy effect. The Black Iris does
  weird extremely well, and it's clear the developer has an eye for this
  particular style of subtle, gnawing horror. It really got under my skin as I
  played it"  PCGamer
  .
  "A lot of games throw around the phrase "cosmic horror" nowadays, but few manage
  to deliver it as well as The Black Iris does. As soon as you step into the
  facility the atmosphere is electric and there's a real feeling of awe as you
  unravel the enormity of what's going on there. The retro styled visuals and
  vibrant purple-hued color palate are superb and the audio design is incredible.
  It's a mind-blowing experience. Highly recommended." AlphaBetaGamer
  .
  "You are presented with a uniquely horrifying world without the need to shove
  gore in your face or hide jump scares around every corner. The Black Iris is an
  unnerving experience that feels like a Lovecraft short story."  Happy Mag

  You can also share the modes you created with your friends very easily. Just
  generate a code in the edit mode, share it with them, they paste it in their

  Bonbon is a short horror story, about your childhood.
  .
  Even if you weren't a small child in the 80s, you've been here before. Just you
  and your friendly toys. But this new friend... this is something you are not yet
  able to understand.
  .
  Includes Steam key.
  .
  Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun:
  .
  "a short, smart tale of domestic horror"
  .
  "Bonbon's home, and the voice of mummy shouting from indoors, is authentic"
  .
  "the confusion between what is real and what isn't, and what is threatening and
  what is malign, rings true"
  .
  "a house of horrors that hit far closer to home than most"
  .
  Matt Wales, Kotaku:
  .
  "it's ambitious, it's often fascinating, and there are elements that linger long
  after it's over"
  .
  "there's a lot to admire and appreciate here - from the thread of an entirely
  different story ... to the clarity of vision and the authentic, evocative period
  atmosphere"
  .
  "there's certainly enough craft and creativity here, and a lingering strangeness
  to this everyday terror"
  .
  Bonbon is a short-form domestic horror narrative (or walking sim, if you like),
  made in Unreal Engine 4, set in a suburban UK home in the 1980s, in which you
  navigate childhood events beyond your capacity to understand, and without
  parental context.
  .
  Play time is around 20 to 40 minutes, depending on your play-style. Progression
  requires the completion of some simple tasks, but it is mostly about exploring
  the objects and events around you. Play with mouse and keyboard, or a 360-style
  gamepad.
  .
  Content warnings:
  .
  Bonbon deals with grown-up themes and suggestions of child-abuse. There is no
  literal violence or onscreen abuse, it is entirely in the subtext.
  .
  There is one jump-scare near the end of the game.
  .
  As one player pointed out in a review, the game does contain a racial slur in
  the dialogue (g***y), which was carefully considered as relevant to the source
  material of the scene, and the setting in the UK in the 1980s.
  .
  If you purchase the DRM-free version via itch.io, you will be able to request a
  Steam key via the link on the download screen.
  .
  Recommended system specifications for Windows PC version:
  .
  GeForce GTX 950, or equivalent/faster graphics card
  .
  Quad-core processor, 2.5GHz or faster
  .
  8Gb RAM or more
  .
  Windows 7 or later

  About:
  .
  Sarah began the rite, but was consumed.
  .
  Thou must complete it.
  .
  Delve into the dream of a dying town in 'Boreal Tenebrae' , a retro-style
  adventure with horror elements.
  .
  Taking cues from the fixed-camera angle games of the PS1 era, and the dream
  logic of works like 'Yume Nikki', vignettes beget vignettes in this web of Trees
  and Streets.
  .
  Explore the interweaving narratives of a northern community, cast adrift in an
  increasingly urbanized world.
  .
  The town is sick,  anger seethes and builds like static in the signal. Will it
  navigate this sea of noise, or be washed away by the 'Degraded Wave'?
  .
  Solve the murder.
  .
  Find Sarah.
  .
  Complete the ritual.
  .
  The truth is deeper still...

  What better way to spend an evening than gathered around listening to a classic
  tale of a brave hero saving a princess from a sinister demon lord bent on ruling
  the world? Sure, it may be the same story you've heard time and time again, but
  don't old stories get better with age?
  .
  So here we find our usual crew. A hero, a demon lord, and a princess all
  congregating to tell the story of the hero's triumph and the defeat of a great
  evil. Everyone here know their role and exactly how to carry it out. But what
  happens when the story doesn't go exactly as we know it? What if someone were to
  rewrite the story to something no one within it knows how to enact? Who's
  responsibility is it to put the story back on its track and find the happy
  ending we all know and love?
  .
  ...Wait, didn't we do this once before?
  .
  Well, let's do it again, and we'll make it bigger and better this time!
  .
  Here Comes Brave Hero Yuusha EX!
  .
  This extended version of original Brave Hero Yuusha is Yuusha as you've never
  seen it before! Join the ragtag crew of the Yuusha, Demon Lord, and the Princess
  as they traverse the land to put the story of The Hero and the Demon back
  together and set the world right! Inspired by older console RPGs, Brave Hero
  Yuusha EX features a colorful visual style while keeping that classic adventure
  feel that you've come to love from RPGs of the 80s and 90s.
  .
  Features:
  .
  5+ hours of that old-timey JRPG goodness.

  A stellar new soundtrack by Agent Ape, and the ability to switch to the original

developer: Brendan Keogh
publisher: Brendan Keogh
genre: Sports;Simulation
description:
  NOTE: This is the original 2018 Pico-8 version and does NOT include the updated
  2022 version available on Steam here.
  .
  Brendan Keogh's Putting Challenge is a Pico-8 golf game about the parts of golf
  that other videogames cut out. Put the ball on the tee yourself. After hitting
  the ball, manually walk to where the ball went before you hit it again. If the
  ball goes in the water, put down another ball! Remove your ball from the hole
  before moving on to the next hole. If you run out of balls, return to the Pro
  Shop to get more balls. This is a golf game with unprecedented interactivity!!
  .
  Sounds tedious? It sort of is! But's it's also kind of relaxing, and it draws
  attention to just how edited and montaged most golf games are in their focus on
  the 'interesting bits'.  Here, the 9-hole course is a single, unified
  experience.
  .
  I've crafted one big world, ten screens by ten screens. Within that world is a
  golf course of 9 holes. You are free to explore and walk around the course, and
  can complete holes in any order you want.
  .
  I developed this game in Pico-8. It was a whole lot of work to get a game of
  this scale and complexity to fit in a Pico-8 cart, and I'm really proud of the
  quality of this final product.
  .
  Wait, why does this game cost $1??
  .
  This is the first time I've set a minimum price for one of my games. All my
  other games are small, quick, slapdash things. While this game is still quite
  small, I also put a considerable amount of work into it over the last few weeks,
  and I think it's important to not contribute to the devaluation of videogame
  labour. So I think it's worth paying a single dollar for. That's less than you'd
  pay for a single round of Time Crisis 2!
  .
  You also get any additional courses I release in the future for free. I've
  already released a second 9-hole course!
  .
  So what do I get?
  .
  $1 unlocks a zip file within which you will find two versions of the game: a
  Pico-8 cart that you can run in Pico-8, if you own a copy of Pico-8; and a HTML5
  version of the game you can run in any browser if you don't own Pico-8. (Note:
  Chrome has issues with audio since an update earlier this year. There's
  workarounds in the readme file. Or just use a different browser.)
  .
  BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!
  .
  Multiple people on Twitter joked that they would pay for golf buggy dlc. WELL
  GUESS WHAT SUCKERS:
  .
  That's right, if you pay $2 for CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION, you get an exclusive day
  one dlc golf buggy! Zip around the golf course up to 4x faster!! Wow!

file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/B/Bringris (USA)/Bringris (USA).json
developer: Zeno Rogue
publisher: Zeno Rogue
genre: Puzzle
description:
  What's the goal?
  .
  Just like in classic falling block games such as Tetris or Blockout, fill the
  levels -- once a whole level (30 cubes) is filled, it disappears. Try to fill as
  many levels as you can!
  .
  How to move?
  .
  wasd to move, space to drop by one level, Enter to drop (you can still move
  after this -- press Enter twice if you don't want to move anymore), hold Shift
  to display cubes missing from the levels below. Press 'p' to pause or see the
  main menu.
  .
  Can I move the camera freely?
  .
  While in pause/main menu, click "explore". You can then use mouse/arrows and
  PageUp/PageDown to freely explore the structure you have built. Do this, the
  views are AMAZING!
  .
  How to rotate?
  .
  There is no key to rotate, but since this game uses non-Euclidean geometry,
  there is no need! Just find a pentagon with five right angles and move along its
  edges.
  .
  (If you change the geometry, a special key for rotation may be necessary -- 'q'
  and 'e' are used for this purpose.)
  .
  How to rotate vertically?
  .
  This game takes place in non-isotropic space -- the 'Z' coordinate works
  differently than the 'XY' plane (which has hyperbolic geometry). Intuitively,
  parallel lines in the XY plane diverge, while vertical lines 'stay parallel'.
  This means that vertical rotation makes no mathematical sense -- the distance
  between the points would change (when rotating around Y axis, points on the XY
  plane would become closer after the rotation, while points on the YZ plane would
  become more distant).
  .
  (You can change the geometry to one where vertical rotation makes sense, but it
  is still not allowed for consistency.)
  .
  But what if you tried to rotate it vertically?
  .
  That's a good question! We do not know if anyone knows. It seems a good research
  question. It is likely that they would resist rotation, just like the springs in
  our world resist changing their shape.
  .
  Why do cubes appear thin when viewed from a distance?
  .
  In hyperbolic geometry, parallel lines diverge, so things become small with
  distance much faster than in Euclidean. Since our space is non-isotropic
  (hyperbolic in XY and Euclidean in YZ), this makes them thinner, but not
  shorter.
  .
  Are the edges of the cubes straight lines?
  .
  Yes -- more formally, they are geodesics. It is clear when the camera is
  positioned right above them. In other positions it may not look so because of
  non-isotropy (see the last answer).
  .
  Why Bringris?
  .
  The "flat level" is a manifold called Bring's surface or Bring's curve, related
  to the small stellated dodecahedron.
  .
  Why is this particular geometry and topology used?
  .
  In the full hyperbolic space, higher levels would have more cubes, which does
  not seem to be a good design for this kind of game. The original plan was to use
  spherical geometry for levels, but that does not give many choices -- only the
  five platonic solids; cube (six squares per level which become cubes in 3D) is
  too small, and icosahedron (20 triangular prisms) and dodecahedron (12
  pentagonal prisms) are very non-intuitive to navigate. Squares with 72 degree
  angles are the best, and Bring's surface is probably the smallest highly
  symmetric surface that can be tessellated with them. With 60-degree angles there
  is another surface (12 squares -- like a cube where every face is doubled and
  you move to the other copy after crossing every edge), but these squares are
  larger, and you could not rotate-by-movement  (with right-angled hexagons you
  could only rotate-by-movement by 180 degrees).
  .
  How is the expert mode different?
  .
  In the normal game mode there is no time limit. In the expert mode, you get less
  and less time for placing the pieces, and also you get score based on how fast
  you are.
  .
  Bringris works with VR!
  .
  Bringris works with SteamVR! (In the Windows version) The game is probably best
  controlled with the keyboard rather than the VR controllers, but it is quite
  cool to explore in VR. You need a powerful graphics card, or change the settings
  (e.g. disable raycasting and/or reduce the number of iterations or cells to draw
  ).
  .
  What engine does it use?
  .
  It is created using the HyperRogue engine aka RogueViz.
  .
  What pieces are available, and what are their frequencies?
  .
  Every piece constructed of 1 to 4 "cubes" is available. The frequency f is
  calculated as follows:
  .
  start with 1
  .
  multiply by the number of symmetries the piece has (identity, vertical,
  horizontal, vertical+horizontal)
  .
  multiply by 2 for purely vertical pieces
  .
  a single cube has frequency 1, not 8
  .
  After a piece is chosen, its frequency is multiplied by 1/2^(1/f).
  .
  What are the differences between the download and the web version?
  .
  The downloadable version has better performance, basic sound effects, and the
  settings can be saved.
  .
  More questions?

  .
  History and Credits
  .
  1.1: introduces alternate geometries, and fixes some bugs (sound effects, score
  counting).
  .
  1.2: more alternate geometries, minor bugfixes, more settings to configure
  .
  1.2b: bugfixes (secret geometries work and are secret (press kl), fixed crash
  after bounded well)
  .
  1.3: added non-orientable hyperbolic manifolds and orbifolds
  .
  1.4: nicer "pentagons" geometry; an option to disable flashes; fixed disabling
  the raycaster; works with VR; nicer wall texture
  .
  1.6: the issue of Bringris crashing on startup on some operating system (unless
  the "Vista compatibility mode" was on) should be fixed. Also updated the engine,
  but this should not have significant effects in Bringris (except the controllers
  shown on the desktop screen in VR).

  Oswald Mandias is a man on a mission: to drag the country kicking and screaming
  back to the glory days of old, where a gentleman could rely on the time-tested
  values of chivalry, breeding and class. Armed with vicious zombies, a stockpile
  of highly questionable pharmaceuticals, and an iron will, he has recruited you
  to grow his plans to fruition.
  .
  Lucky you.
  .
  In this darkly-humorous visual novel adventure, you'll tackle fiendish puzzles,
  decide which very curious characters to trust, and compete in a pub quiz where
  the sudden death round means just that. Will you consign Oswald's plot to the
  dustbin of history, or will the past come back to life- in more ways than one?

  This is the follow up to The Bunny Hill Horror. It is not recommended for under
  15s and caution is advised for those of a sensitive nature. So... you've been
  warned...

  Bury me my Love tells the story of Syrian refugee Nour and her husband Majd, as
  Nour
  .
  undertakes a perilous journey to safety in Europe.
  .
  Bury me, my Love is a Text Messaging Adventure game about Nour, a Syrian migrant
  trying to find her way to Europe. Her husband Majd, who remains behind in Syria,
  communicates with Nour through a messaging app, advising her as best he can so
  that she reaches her destination safely.
  .
  "Bury me, my love" is a Syrian goodbye phrase that roughly means, "Take care,
  don't even think about dying before I do." This phrase takes on a deeper meaning
  as Majd says it to his wife, Nour, as she undertakes her perilous journey to
  reach Europe.
  .
  A co-production from ARTE, the European cultural network, with The Pixel Hunt
  and Figs.
  .
  A game in an instant messaging app

  emojis, pics and selfies, relevant links...

  Your choices in Bury me, my Love truly impact on the story, with Nour able to
  visit 50 different locations and reach 19 potential different endings with
  widely divergent outcomes.
  .
  Based on real-life events
  .
  Bury me, my Love is a "reality-inspired game", a documented fiction that draws
  inspiration directly from real-world events. The original idea stems from an
  article written by Le Monde journalist, telling the story of Dana, a young
  Syrian woman who fled her country and is now living in Germany.

game: CROSSNIQ+ (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/C/CROSSNIQ+ (USA)/CROSSNIQ+ (USA).json
developer: Max Krieger
publisher: Max Krieger
genre: Puzzle

  .
  CROSSNIQ+ (CROSS-neek plus) is a speed-focused, arcade-style puzzle game
  inspired by "y2k-era" visual design - a tribute to highly polished, small-scope
  Japanese games from the late 90's.
  .
  In CROSSNIQ+, the name of the game is re-arranging a grid of tiles to form
  "crosses" - rows and column of the same color. You can move tiles up, down, left
  or right - but moving them off the edge of the grid makes them wrap back to the
  other side, offering a unique and brain-bending challenge that's been compared
  to a mix between matching games and a color cube. Unlike other popular puzzle
  games, CROSSNIQ+ focuses on speed and technique rather than chains or combos -
  make crosses quickly and set up multi-crosses to earn bonuses.
  .
  In Endless mode, keep making crosses to keep your timer filled - let it hit
  empty, and your game is over. In Time Attack, your time is a set amount - earn
  as many points as you can before the buzzer sounds.
  .
  Play against a friend in Versus, complete with items and special moves...
  .
  ...or simply relax to a variety of different, aesthetically striking playfields
  in Chillout mode, where there's no score, timer, or game overs. No matter your
  playstyle, there's a mode in CROSSNIQ+ for you!
  .
  Let's Cross! Aim for THE TOP!

  Buying this package will give you an insight into my process as well as allowing
  me to continue developing new strange XR apps!   As I make new ones, I will
  upload them for y'all to try.

  I *can't* guarantee that all of these will work, or even make sense. However, I
  *can* guarantee that they are very weird!
  .
  Currently included are the following sketches:
  .
  4L1: An experiment in size constraints! you can 'blow' on the big walls, and
  also make sure that you stick your head in back wall! If you happen to have the
  exact size and layout of my old room, plop your mattress on the floor and align
  it to that awesome flowery bed!
  .
  Gallery-r : This was one made with Luke Iannini, the briliant mind behind
  'Rumpus VR' . We wanted to see what it was like to do some fun lil ray trace
  toys within VR
  .
  jRoom: Multiplayer strange land where you can hang out with some jellyfish
  .
  lizRoomBug: This was an earlier version of my lil donut tests. With this one you
  can press the thumb pad to 'freeze' the jiggliness in its current position,
  slowly disforming the space into nothingnesss
  .
  McScene2 : a test of outdoor photogrammetry taken during a trip to glacier
  national park
  .
  peaceParticles:  A simple particle sim to play with!
  .
  PlayRoom: A bunch of gooeyness combined with ropes strings and grass! was on
  show on Adobe!

genre: Puzzle
description:
  Campfire Cooking is a puzzle game about relaxing moments in nature, as you
  prepare meals over a warm fire. Discover the joy of cooking on a stick and test
  your problem-solving skills with some challenging campfire puzzles! My latest
  creation is guaranteed to make you feel clever, hungry and eager to book your
  next woodland escape.
  .
  Over 100 meals to prepare.
  .
  Solve tricky puzzles with one simple goal; prepare the all the food, cooked to
  perfection and with a hint of smoke. When each meal is ready it's time to trek
  to the next campsite. But don't be fooled: these puzzles are no walk in the
  park, and some of them are a hike up the mountain!
  .
  Meet the family.
  .
  A year long trip and a lot of marshmallows to toast. Follow a vacation like no
  other and listen to the campers as they tell stories, laugh at each other's
  jokes or moan about the lack of cell phone reception. Enjoy the simple moments
  they share around the fire while waiting for their food to be cooked.
  .
  Puzzle-solving, with a twist.
  .
  Twist, rotate and jostle skewers around the fire until each meal is ready to
  eat. Push fondue pots, play with magnets or maybe just use a camping stove if
  the fire won't light. Discover clever ways to solve puzzles at each new locale.
  .
  Visit exotic hiking trails
  .
  Once you've visited all the campsites on one trail, why not hike to another?
  Each trail brings you new vistas brimming with color, different foods to cook
  and fresh fireside stories to hear. Take a journey from the deep woodlands to
  snow-capped peaks, and everywhere in between.
  .
  Please Note: Campfire Cooking currently only supports mouse controls!
  .
  I'll be doing my best to update the game with keyboard and controller support
  soon. Feel free to leave any comments/questions below. Cheers, Hawkes.

  FROM THE DEVELOPER
  .
  Hey!
  .
  Sometimes, you get an idea and you just wanna turn that idea into a game. Real
  quick. No extensive planning. No big budget estimates. You just wanna get in
  there and get dirty with the gameplay, code and graphics.
  .
  At Hello There Games, we are constantly at work with several bigger productions.
  We love them, and they take up most of our time. But every now and then there's
  an hour there, half a day here. That's where this game got done.
  .
  It's not pixel-perfect-polished. It's not the deepest experience out there. It's
  not the biggest title we've shipped. It's not the smallest either.
  .
  But it is something that we really had fun developing, and really really really
  wanted to share with you before the summer vacation.
  .
  We sincerely hope that you will have fun with it.
  .
  With love,
  .

  Kingdom!
  .
  Catlandia is developed by a small team of independent developers as a passion
  project. We love cats, and wanted to create an opportunity for you to be a cat
  yourself. We also think there's an audience for games you don't have to play
  forever - by design, we created Catlandia as an experience that can be picked
  up, enjoyed, and finished without a huge investment of time - yet allow it to
  fit within a larger narrative. We're excited to share this first peak into
  Catlandia with the Itch community.
  .
  This version of Catlandia includes the free Trouble at The Tall House update - a
  story expansion that lets your cats explore new areas, fight new bosses, and
  find more costumes!

developer: Niklas Riewald
publisher: Niklas Riewald
genre: Simulation
description:
  Cell Tune is a life simulation game. You design creatures on a microscopic level
  and let them fight with other organisms.
  .
  Building your creatures is easy: There are five different cell types that you
  can combine in any way you want. But designing an organism that can strive is
  not quite so simple. You have to consider the level layout and many different
  construction tradeoffs: Little organisms can reproduce very fast but are also
  quickly eaten by bigger ones. Aggressive creatures can decimate your enemies,
  but they are also more likely to digest their own children by accident. And you
  probably don't want an organism that just swims against a wall all the time.
  .
  The game has a tutorial, 12 levels and a level editor. The level editor can be
  used for local multiplayer.
  .
  FAQ:
  .
  Why is there no kick drum like I was promised in the trailer?
  .
  Unfortunately, I had to remove the kick drum because it made the music click and
  pop sometimes. But the good news is that the game will be 50% off, as long as I
  don't get around to including the kick drum again. Yay!
  .
  This makes me sad. Is there a way to turn the kick drum back on?
  .
  Rejoice! There is a way to turn it back on. Just install PureData, then go to
  media/PureData/pd_cellTune_nik2.pd, then go to menuMusic -> drums and connect pd
  kick with pd submixer drums.
  .
  Wait, does this mean I can change up the music system in any way I want?
  .
  Yes, it does. The possibilities with this are endless! (the same thing applies
  to the graphics btw)
  .
  Will there be a Steam version?
  .
  No plans for that. The game will probably stay an itch.io exclusive. If this
  game will sell a million copies I might reconsider.
  .
  This game made me realize that complex behaviour can emerge from quite simple
  rules. Can I use this game to build a human creature having a real soul?
  .
  Glad you ask. It might be possible. But please consider the ethical implications
  before you do so!
  .
  Do you have other games?
  .
  Yes! Please check out my latest game. It's called Wildfox Surfing Paradise and
  it's a surfing game based on a sophisticated fluid simulation.

  CLT is an arcade shooter where enemies learn behaviours from those that went
  before * WebGL Demo * Win/Mac/Linux Versions
  .
  Wait, What Is It?
  .
  Central Limit Theorem is a survival shooter where you have to protect your core
  for as long as you can from the shapes attacking it. It's a quick, simple,
  stressful, high-score shooter designed to be played between other, more
  substantial games.
  .
  Each enemy starts with a unique behaviour (they can shoot, weave, or orbit) and
  they each leave a different coloured ink on the playfield. When another enemy
  crosses this ink later it will learn the behaviours of those that went before!
  .
  The more ink, the more difficult the game becomes!
  .
  * IDGA Scotland Community Choice Award (Edinburgh Winner 2018) *
  .
  How Do I Play It?
  .
  [Fire] - Ctrl/Space
  .
  [Pause] - ESC/P (Use 'P' above as ESC does some odd things with the web player!)
  .
  [Rotate] - Arrow Keys/WASD
  .
  A tutorial will play the first time you run the game. It can be played again by
  shooting the 'Help' button. Shoot the 'Play' button to start a game!
  .
  Protect your core for as long as you can, and aim for a high score!
  .
  Why Should I Buy It?
  .
  Beyond supporting me and encouraging me to make more games, if you buy the game,
  you'll get a proper, customisable Unity-style executable for Windows, Mac, and
  Linux. This will allow you to have:
  .
  *  Higher resolution and different aspect ratios!
  .
  *  Better anti-aliasing for smoother graphics!
  .
  *  The ability to easily save a picture of any run by shooting the 'Photo'
  button
  .
  *  A 'secret' bonus alternative game mode! (Try shooting things in the main
  menu)
  .
  *  Probably much better performance!
  .
  ATTENTION: The design might cause some difficulties for any of you lovely people
  with colour perception issues. Please try the demo and check out the screenshots
  before buying to make sure you won't be disappointed! I believe the game is
  still playable, but it might be more difficult!
  .
  LINUX USERS: Linux graphics drivers and Unity don't seem to play 100% nicely
  together, even when using 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 or newer (the supported Linux OS
  from Unity). Testers reported running in fullscreen causes occasional problems,
  but that windowed mode runs fine. Your mileage may vary!
  .
  When Was It Made?
  .
  I couldn't get along to the Global Game Jam 2018 (#GGJ18), but I decided to
  create something within the same time frame. The theme was 'transmission', so I
  allowed enemies to transmit their behaviours to each other via ink! Since then
  loads of new features and polish have been added to Cental Limit Theorem!

  .
  Description
  .
  Changeling is a GxB, non-stat raising, full-length visual novel about love,
  reconciliation, and trying to survive in a dangerous supernatural world. Play
  through about 30-40 hours of content and over 40 unique endings while trying to
  survive the perils of a newly discovered paranormal community. Romance one of 6
  love interests as you uncover information about the supernatural and the secrets
  from your own past - all while you try to patch up your relationship with your
  twin brother who grows more and more suspicious of you with each passing day.
  .
  Story
  .
  The human world accepted as reality is only a thin veneer under which lies a
  world of supernatural creatures, entities, and people. They live beside humans
  hiding their nature or walking among them unseen. And most people go about their
  lives entirely unaware of the dangers around them. Mysterious situations are
  written off as fake, or they're glossed over with some sort of mundane
  explanation.
  .
  The same was true for Nora, a normal girl struggling with the usual litany of
  everyday problems - including her crumbling relationship with an angry,
  resentful twin brother with whom she's nearly given up on reconciling.
  .
  But her family's return to the town in which she'd grown up set in motion a
  chain of events that would shatter every illusion she had about a world she
  thought she knew. Her eyes newly opened to the truth around her, Nora begins a
  journey to uncover the secrets of her own mysterious past and the reason for her
  brother's bitter hatred toward her. Alongside her best friend, and a group of
  unusual guys she met after her return, Nora begins to chip away at the lies
  shrouding her life. Lies that have been haunting her since childhood.
  .
  But in a world where Vampires, Werewolves, and Faeries are real, learning the
  truth may come at a high cost.

  Chess Mix is a turn-based tactical game set in the REAL world of Chess, where
  they party all day long and hang out and chill and generally have a great time.
  .
  Meet lots of strange, cool friends who have their own weird strengths and
  weaknesses. Unlock new songs that give you cool passive powers and build them
  into powerful playlists! Dance, kiss, eat pizza, and do other stuff too!!
  .
  -----
  .
  How to play
  .
  You're moving pieces around the board, using abilities (on the little cards on
  the bottom) and gaining as many Cool Points as you can before the day is over.
  There are currently about a dozen or so different pieces in the game, and each
  party locale has its own special rules and features.
  .
  Tap on a unit to find out where it can move to. Then you can click one of the
  destinations to move it there.
  .
  When a unit is selected, you can also see its abilities on the bottom of the
  screen. If you use an ability, you have to wait a few turns before you can use
  it again - this is called a "cooldown". Wait a few more turns and then try
  again.
  .
  Songs and Playlists
  .
  You start with 2 songs unlocked, but as you gain more stars, more will be
  unlocked. Each song does a different thing passively as you play (you can click
  the Karaoke machine to remind you just what the song's a-doin').
  .
  Probably some songs go good with some kinds of units or something, but you
  probably will also just have your favorite songs. Try stuff out!
  .
  Good luck! <3

  wrath. Everything is boosted by outstanding pixel art and a memorable chiptune
  soundtrack.
  .
  You can download for FREE the demo of our game!

  Switch between the protagonists in real-time. Kensei is a samurai who wields a
  lethal katana, but he lacks the ability to jump. Ayame the kunoichi is as fast
  as fragile and uses ranged attacks. Combine their skills to save feudal Japan!
  .
  Overcome old-school platforming challenges. Although retro platformers are our
  main reference, we tried to bring the most satisfying, modern experience to the
  table. Ayame can jump gracefully while Kensei will dash through enemies and
  platforms.
  .
  Fast-paced combat. Chronicles of 2 Heroes' offers a tight combat system that
  changes depending on which character you control. The samurai guarantees
  breathtaking duels using its katana and the ability to parry. The kunoichi can
  vanish behind the enemy to avoid close combat or damage foes from a distance.
  .
  Unlock up to 20 powerful abilities. During their journey, Ayame and Kensei will
  upgrade their abilities. From smashing the ground and stunning your enemies to
  double jumping and reaching higher platforms. These siblings can learn a lot of
  new tricks!
  .
  Imagine a good action platformer without enemies. Impossible, right? Don't
  worry: Chronicles of 2 Heroes is filled with them! Fight against ronin, yokai,
  and countless enemies inspired by Japanese mythology, each one with distinct
  designs and patterns.

  CLAM MAN 2: OPEN MIC is OUT NOW on STEAM AND ITCH!
  .
  The free prologue for the sequel is out already!  Clam Man 2: Open Mic by
  Marafrass
  .
  If you enjoy it, leave a review! It's a huge help for small developers like
  myself, especially with Clam being a personal project with basically 0$ behind
  it!
  .
  Clam Man
  .
  is the story of the Clam Man. Intriguing, isn't it? Yes, it's true - he is a
  clam and yet also a man. This is not a topic of debate, it is fact. We've
  confirmed it while working on this game. Using science.
  .
  "He certainly is a clam man." - Playtester
  .
  Thank You, Playtester - we couldn't agree more.
  .
  But to be more specific: This is the story of a man, recently promoted to junior
  sales representative, enjoying the comforts and leisure of lower-mid-level
  office work. However, things suddenly take a turn for the worse, and the Clam
  Man is cast into an adventure full of danger, suspicion, and mystery. Join him,
  as he unravels the conspiracy behind the tragic event that befalls him, and
  fight to restore CLAMMY JUSTICE to the world of Snacky Bay.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  A story full of twists and turns and a huge amount of strange jokes!
  .
  More than 20 unique and strange characters to interact with! (I really like the
  jellyfish personally)
  .
  A spectacular original soundtrack!
  .
  Lots of plants
  .
  Umm
  .
  Phone calls!
  .
  Puzzles!
  .
  Knots!
  .
  The most evil bad guy in the history of evil bad guys
  .
  Anime fight scene!
  .
  Our boys in blue!
  .
  And of course, a duck.
  .
  WHOAH WHOAH WHOAH ENOUGH WITH THE JOKES What is all this about even
  .
  Clam Man is a point'n'click adventure game, with an emphasis on story rather
  than puzzles. We wanted to create a game focused on the parts we loved about old
  school adventure games - the story and the jokes. It's a simple, entertaining
  game where you explore the world and interact with it's inhabitants. Oh, and we
  did throw a few puzzles in here and there, too.
  .
  IS THE CLAM MAN FOR ME?
  .
  I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a pretty cool person. I'll just ask a
  couple questions to figure that out:
  .
  Do you enjoy story-driven games?
  .
  Do you enjoy absurd and strange comedy?
  .
  Do you want to relax and play a game where the primary objective is to make you
  laugh at said strange comedy?
  .
  Have you got a thing for ridiculous underwater settings and weird, nonsensical
  stories?
  .
  well yeah you know in that case it's definitely for you
  .
  Much love,
  .

  .
  A chill game about using plants to overgrow abandoned wasteland dioramas
  .
  Harness the power of nature to overgrow lo-fi scenes of urban decay and
  manufactured landscapes. Create small plant-covered dioramas of brutalism and
  beauty by planting seeds, repurposing hundreds of discarded objects and creating
  unique structures for nature to reclaim.
  .
  Dive into a relaxing sandbox mode with no goals, or take on a multi-chapter
  "campaign" where the task is to strike a balance between the natural and the
  manufactured. Adding objects will encourage lush vegetation to grow, but each
  object must be covered in foliage in order to proceed.
  .
  Cloud Gardens hovers somewhere in between a sandbox toy and a game with
  challenges. Partly a gardening simulator, partly a dystopian landscape builder,
  and partly a puzzle game that is both satisfying and without frustration. It is
  a relaxing experience that takes you from one scene to the next while
  encouraging creativity and coming up with your own solutions.
  .
  This is a chill game where the primary goal is to delight in your own
  creativity. Players can download looping videos of their completed dioramas and
  share them with other gardeners from across the internet, and our Discord server

  remember your first solo shopping trip?

  co-open is a game about a kid's first time buying groceries on their own. Looks
  like it's time to explore and have some fun!

  .
  The products available in the local cooperatively run store are community-
  selected, trying to suit everybody's needs. You might not find everything you're
  expecting, but maybe there will be something that surprises you! Check the
  information on product price tags to make sure you only pick fresh local
  produce, call your grandmother for a suggestion, or just go with whatever
  catches your eye! Just try not to feed the store cats off the shelves. Please.
  They are fed regularly.
  .
  anything else?
  .
  You can get your ice cream and veggies in a few minutes to rush back home sooner
  - or stray away from the shelves and find yourself a part of a drawing class in
  the rooftop park, or an underground snowskating hangout! Don't be scared to
  check things out.
  .
  making memories
  .
  Looks like your neighbor friend is also shopping today! But could you meet
  anybody else? What if it's a very (very) big crow, or a mysterious vent dweller?
  Maybe you will even get to keep some meaningful mementos from your adventures!
  .
  so, how was your day?
  .
  In the end, grandma will always come to pick you up. What will she say about
  your shopping trip - or, more importantly, about your product picks?

  Remember those lovable-cheap "20 (or 40 or 50 or 100) Games For Windows" CD-
  ROM's that were available everywhere in the 1990's?
  .
  Well, I wrote a lot of those games. If you bought one of those $9.95 CD-ROM
  discount packs from Expert or Cosmi, you have probably played my games. And now
  those games seem to be available in a lot of those "abandonware" sites for free
  download, despite the fact that I still own all the rights.
  .
  If you liked those old games, and you actually want to own 'em legally, you're
  in luck, because I've packaged FIFTY of my old games in a brand new "Retro
  Pack". It's just like your old "Super Amazing Games for Windows 95", except it
  actually runs on newer stuff.
  .
  The Retro Pack has arcade games! You can test your sushi-eating and squid-
  avoidance with Suzy Sushi. You can hone your skills defeating aliens in Invaders
  From Neptune and Zap Pod. You can dodge crazy drivers in Head On Collision or
  blast enemy tanks in Think Tank. There is even an oddball arcade version of
  Poker!
  .
  You may have played the old standard card solitaire and dice games a million
  times, but have you tried Siege, Vanishing Cross, Kizbot or Brain Bones? The
  Code Zone Retro Pack has some interesting new games that you will enjoy learning
  and (hopefully) winning.
  .
  The Retro Pack has several fun board games. Whether it is classic stuff like
  Backgammon or Moku, or if you want a new kind of challenge with PangKi or
  Engulf, the Retro Pack has what you need.
  .
  If your brain needs some exercise, the Retro Pack has brain benders! If you like
  word games, there are some great Cryptograms. If logic puzzles are what you need
  to keep your brain trained, you can test your skills in Deductive Logic.
  Finally, if you think you know everything about how to beat Tic-Tac-Toe, see how
  well you do in 3D!
  .
  And to top it all off, every game has plenty of variations and options
  available, so you can change the challenge once you think you have mastered the
  game.

game: Codemancer (USA)

developer: Important Little Games
publisher: Important Little Games
genre: Educational;Puzzle
description:
  **UPDATE** Mac & PC Builds now have translated text in Spanish, French, German
  and the original English!
  .
  Codemancer brings the mystery of magic and the exhilaration of learning to code
  together in a fantasy universe that uses spell casting as a way to teach and
  learn programming skills. Codemancer's fantasy universe is filled with rival
  sorcerers and their minions for players to encounter along their journey.
  Codemancer is a non-violent, entertaining, and educational game designed to be
  inclusive and accessible to learners at any stage. Features include a gender-
  neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and a
  programming interface that's designed to be easy to understand by kids with
  varying degrees of skill and experience. Codemancer breaks down barriers that
  may have discouraged some kids from embracing technology and elevates their
  screentime to be more productive and entertaining.  It isn't a typical coding or
  technology game.
  .
  WHAT IS CODEMANCER ALL ABOUT?
  .
  Codemancer tells a moving story about Aurora, a young, creatively talented girl
  who's trying to grow up, become independent, and do good in the world in the
  face of incredible obstacles when her father is suddenly kidnapped. Aurora has
  to embark on an adventure to save him as she grows into a gracious and
  independent young woman. She must learn magic spells to save her father, but the
  magic used in Aurora's world works the same as programming does in ours. Inspire
  children to explore their potential as they discover the magic of coding.
  .
  CODEMANCER IS AN EDUCATIONAL GAMING ADVENTURE:
  .
  Codemancer is designed for 6 to 12 year olds as an educational game that teaches
  the magic behind coding-and can be fun for grownups, too!
  .
  CODEMANCER SPECIFICALLY TEACHES:
  .
  Sequential Algorithms
  .
  Debugging
  .
  Function Arguments
  .
  Scope
  .
  Looping Constructs
  .
  Concurrent Programming
  .
  ...AND TEACHES IN GENERAL:
  .
  Computational Thinking
  .
  Planning
  .
  Problem Solving
  .
  Resilience
  .
  CODEMANCER FEATURES:
  .
  A narrative inspired by popular works of young adult fantasy worlds such as
  Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Neverending Story, The Last Airbender, and many
  more!
  .
  Gameplay that takes place in a hexagonal world, making it easy to estimate
  distances and angles by eye.
  .
  'Freeze time' ability, so players can debug the programs they've written and
  potentially code their way out of a jam to learn from their mistakes.
  .
  Availability for PC, Mac, iPad, and Android tablets.
  .
  CODEMANCER IS STRUCTURED FOR ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSIVITY:
  .
  The goal of Codemancer is to be as broadly inclusive as possible by creating a
  gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone,
  and language interface that's designed to make the game appeal to kids at
  different skill levels.
  .
  Codemancer breaks down barriers that can hinder some kids from feeling
  comfortable with engaging with programming, for example Codemancer uses pips
  (like on a die) instead of numerals, and sets the gameplay in a hexagonal world
  that makes it easy to estimate distances and angles by eye.
  .
  No syntax errors -- if you can enter a spell, it will run. Syntax errors can be
  frustrating and cause learners to quit before they really begin.
  .
  Codemancer uses an open dyslexic font, where letters are designed to look
  distinctly different from each other to make reading easier for kids with
  dyslexia.
  .
  The game is fully voiced, so reading is completely optional.
  .
  Codemancer's programming language is designed to be accessible, but also
  translates easily to a variety of popular real-world programming languages (such
  as Python).
  .
  Codemancer appeals to many educational groups, from children with special needs
  for reading, to younger children new to coding, to older children with more
  advanced coding and programming skill sets.
  .
  Codemancer has the potential to reach under-represented groups in coding and
  teach them an often-exclusionary, but nonetheless important, 20th-century skill.

  Collateral Thinking - No Fix Is Quicker!
  .
  Collateral Thinking DX is an arcade-style action platformer that's all about
  beating up alien ghosts and recovering blueprints on a tight schedule (and
  budget) to save the true victims - billionaires!
  .
  Each level is a self-contained screen that gives you one of four specific tasks
  to complete in 30 short seconds - to "Avoid" the hazards, to "Beat" the enemies,
  to "Collect" the blueprints, or to "Defeat" the one of the fiendish bosses.
  These quickfire challenges force you to quickly survey your surroundings and
  then jump into action in order to progress through the 100+ floors and net as
  much cash as possible along the way. You can climb Spearmint Tower solo, or
  bring along a friend to share in the frustration!
  .
  The game starts with the core floor-climbing, obstacle-negotiation of Donkey
  Kong and piles on the original Mario Bros.' single-screen management, and then
  cranks up the speed for slippier, sloppier silliness. With over 100 levels,
  unlockable characters, multiplayer action, and toe-tapping tunes, Collateral
  Thinking DX is more than ready to satisfy your arcade addiction!

  --> 100+ Levels!

  Containment is a small, minimalist strategy/simulation game where you try to
  maintain the growth of bacteria. The core gameplay is easy to pick up but very
  challenging to master. The game can be completed in one sitting, but has
  leaderboards and challenging goals to accomplish that might take longer!
  .
  Core Gameplay
  .
  Containment is turn-based; the bacteria proliferate, you fight back, and the
  cycle continues. There are a number of rules that give depth to the strategy
  involved in achieving three stars on each level:
  .
  You have a limited number of doses
  .
  Intentionally ending your turn early and letting the bacteria grow lets you
  research stronger antibiotics
  .
  All bacteria lose one health per turn
  .
  Any bacteria without neighbors die the next turn
  .
  Every isolated bacteria gains you bonus points
  .
  Each extra dose at the end of the game earns you bonus points
  .
  Aesthetic
  .
  The game features a mix of cute and sleek design with a visually pleasing color
  palette and satisfying interactions in every corner. The music is soothing and
  relaxing to listen to while you battle the unending bacterial proliferation.
  .
  Content
  .
  The game contains the following amount of content:
  .
  Comprehensive and interactive tutorial
  .
  9 brain-teasing and challenging levels
  .
  A creative sandbox mode (unlocked at the end of the game)

description:
  Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! is the massive sequel to the surprise best selling
  original, one of the few games that gives players complete control on how they
  want to build their restaurant.
  .
  The game starts like any other morning at SherriSoda Tower as you take the
  elevator up to open Cook, Serve, Delicious!, a platinum star restaurant that was
  surging in popularity thanks to your amazing chef and management skills. Just
  then, a swarm of police surround SherriSoda Tower. It seems the SherriSoda head
  executives were secretly stealing funds from the company at the same time they
  were incurring a staggering amount of debt, draining the accounts of the tower
  and several of the businesses inside of it, including CSD. Just like that, the
  tower was closed and put up for federal auction, including everything inside of
  it. It was all over... the Cook, Serve, Delicious! restaurant was no more.
  .
  Angry but determined to rebuild, you've scrounged up all of your personal life's
  savings and bought commercial space inside the Teragon Supertower, the largest
  skyscraper in the city. It's here that you will start a brand new Cook, Serve,
  Delicious! restaurant, build it back to its former glory, and rebuild your
  legacy as the best chef in the world.
  .
  Features include:
  .
  A 60+ hour experience as you build your restaurant from a roach infested eatery
  to a World Class Platinum Star experience by either running your own restaurant
  or branching out as a chef for hire, where you take jobs within the tower and
  various restaurants as you gain experience with the large array of foods, which
  spans 400 levels across 33 restaurants!
  .
  Several modes including Classic Mode that brings back the classic gameplay of
  the original, Stress mode that instantly rockets the difficulty to the highest
  setting, and Zen mode, which allows you to take it easy and relaxes many of the
  stressful elements to provide an easy day of cooking.
  .
  All new gameplay features and additions, with a greater flexibility of
  difficulty for those who like it casual or insanely difficult.
  .
  Over 200 foods, sides, drinks and desserts to choose from, a staggering increase
  from the 30 foods in the original game.
  .
  New local co-op mode! The all new split screen co-op feature allows you to play
  through the entire game with two players, with the ability for players to drop
  in and out during your progress within the game.
  .
  Tons of lore including an email system with over 600 emails, unlockable secrets,
  and tons more!
  .
  Unlock over 1,200 restaurant objects and design your restaurant however you'd
  like with the Designer mode.
  .
  All new 1080p native/60fps code.

  This is a gravity-based arcade game inspired by classics like Lunar Lander and
  Space Taxi. You'll pilot your craft from pad to pad trying to beat your best
  time - then flirt with that fine line between speed and control.
  .
  If you're brave enough to try Hard Mode you'll be flopping around like a QWOPy,
  low gravity turtle. With a little practice you'll be zippin' around doin' barrel
  rolls. You can also pilot your lander in virtual reality with your Oculus Rift.
  .
  You'll see sites from the cutting edge of fractal mathematics - bizarre organic
  shapes, arcane archaeological digs, and all manner of WTFderful alien vistas.
  You'll also find a variety of physics-based obstacles and challenges to test
  your piloting skills. Each level is a hand-crafted landscape that encourages the
  player to explore - and goof around!
  .
  Version 3 now available with new levels, new options menu, improved VR support,
  fresh sound effects.

  Crescent Loom is the very first biologically-realistic nervous system simulation
  game. It lets you - in a hands-on, mad-scientist way - tinker with everything
  from neurotransmitter to the ecological niche of an animal.

  So dive in and maybe - just maybe - by poking around with these simple creatures
  you'll figure something out about how your own body ticks.

  Lead Your Followers Into the Future!
  .
  Your word is gospel in this god sim set in Sub-Saharan Africa. Influence and try
  to control your followers using commandments but beware, free will leaves these
  open to interpretation. Will you create a flourishing civilization or lead them
  to death and destruction?
  .
  About This Game
  .
  Welcome to Crest, a unique take on the traditional god sim, where your word is
  gospel. Control and guide your followers by issuing commandments written in an
  evolving pictographic language.
  .
  How these commandments are interpreted and remembered is not set in stone. What
  you communicate and what experiences your followers have with the environment is
  the basis for their religion. Over time, commandments can develop different
  associations and completely change their meaning. After all, your followers
  still have free will and will sometimes do what they think is best for them,
  regardless of what you had in mind.
  .
  The consequences of your actions may not always be clear and you will need to be
  aware of the ever-changing environment, your people's beliefs and their feelings
  about you.
  .
  Will they love, respect or fear you?
  .
  Key Features
  .
  Create your own religion, nurture your followers and observe how they evolve, or
  die, as a result of your decisions - including the unintended consequences of
  your commands!
  .
  Sandbox-style gameplay: Oversee a world where weather, vegetation, mineral
  deposits, drought and animal behavior will create surprises
  .
  Weave your own stories through trial and error. The history of your people will
  be chronicled and presented to you at the end of your vigil using the in-game
  storybuilder.
  .
  Progress by unlocking new words, increasing the complexity of your commandments
  .
  Customize the difficulty of your games with various amounts of resources,
  animals, islands and overall island quality
  .
  Built-in Twitch support: When you live-stream the game on Twitch, your viewers
  can join your cities and vote on commandments to help or disrupt your godly
  plans
  .
  Setting
  .
  Crest is an Afrofuturist game that reimagines how humanity arose in the cradle
  of humankind on the African continent. It's a historical themed game that tries
  to emulate an advanced iron age civilization that could have existed a few
  thousand years ago. The setting for the game world, its flora and fauna is based
  on African biomes, with rainfall determining the tug-of-war between desert,
  savanna and jungle.
  .
  Progression and Losing
  .
  Every new world you start is unique and will write its own stories. If all your
  followers die, that world is gone forever. However, you will still be able to
  view the legacy of your previous worlds. As long as your people live you can
  continue playing and further shape your own history by creating more and more
  complex commandments with newly unlocked words.

  This retro-inspired 2D Action RPG might outright surprise you. CrossCode
  combines 16-bit SNES-style graphics with butter-smooth physics, a fast-paced
  combat system, and engaging puzzle mechanics, served with a gripping sci-fi
  story.
  .
  CrossCode is all about how it plays! That's why there is a free demo! Go give it
  a try!
  .
  Take the best out of two popular genres, find a good balance between them and
  make a great game. That's what CrossCode does. And it works pretty well. You get
  the puzzles of Zelda-esque dungeons and are rewarded with the great variety of
  equipment you know and love from RPGs. During the fast-paced battles you will
  use the tools you find on your journey to reveal and exploit the enemies'
  weaknesses and at the same time will be able to choose equipment and skills for
  a more in-depth approach in fighting your enemies.
  .
  Check the Reviews (On Steam, GOG, Gamejolt, heck all over the net!) to see who
  loves the game. We're sure you will, too!

description:
  You are a robot tasked with producing crystals.  Organize a never ending supply
  of them and see how long you can last!
  .
  Controls:
  .
  arrow keys/wasd:
  .
  places/grows/cracks a crystal if possible
  .
  grow/crack crystals by stacking crystals of the same color
  .
  moves that don't use crystal discharge your jump instead (cursor turns red)
  .
  you start with a jump (white cursor) and recharge it when you crack a crystal
  .
  space/x (action):
  .
  charge jump, move the preview to the next crystal
  .
  at position 3, action moves the preview back to position 1
  .
  the heart cost for moving the preview back down increases (1-2-3-3...)
  .
  useful when you get stuck, but comes at a cost
  .
  u/z (undo):
  .
  you can undo all moves that don't generate a new color
  .
  click on the digit 3 to disable arcade mode (enables undo for all moves)
  .
  r (reset):
  .
  used to restart at any point (careful, can't be undone)
  .
  mouse:
  .
  tap next to the player to move to that cell
  .
  tapping on the active piece preview triggers action
  .
  Hints:
  .
  the more of these you read, the less you get to figure out yourself (SPOILERS
  AHEAD)
  .
  try to keep your jump for a move sequence that cracks a crystal, since that
  recharges your jump
  .
  crystals with neighbors of the same color are more likely to require a jump to
  leave from, try to keep the neighbors distinct
  .
  alternating between jumping and cracking crystals (then jumping to the next
  crystal to crack) can get you far
  .
  if you reach 5 hearts you will trigger a crystal anomaly (not easy)

genre: Action
description:
  The crystals return!
  .
  Crystal Control II is the follow-up to one of our most successful releases. The
  original game, released in 2014, was a competitive game for two local players
  with some bullet hell elements. Because that core gameplay seemed to resonate so
  well with the fans, we decided to stick pretty closely to the original formula
  for the sequel...but with some interesting new twists!
  .
  Features:
  .
  Local multiplayer action for two! Fight for control of the crystals to gain more
  firepower and take out your opponent...you only need to get one hit on them to
  win!
  .
  Easy to learn, hard to master! We've seen players of all skill levels pick up
  the game and understand it's simple controls. Don't let the simplicity fool you,
  though! The skill ceiling can be quite high, giving room for the competitive
  folks to shine.
  .
  Eight playable characters! Each character has different movement speeds, charge
  shots, and "Control" abilities (which can be executed after capturing more than
  half of the total crystals on-screen)!
  .
  Solo practice mode! Crystal Control II was designed from the ground up as a
  competitive game for two players, but if you don't have a friend nearby you can
  still enjoy our new target practice mode. try to get a high score on every
  stage!
  .
  This game is best enjoyed with one or more gamepads!
  .
  Crystal Control II is best played with two gamepads, but the game also includes
  two alternate modes if you only have one (keyboard vs gamepad or shared single
  gamepad).
  .
  Unfortunately, it's impossible to play the Versus mode of Crystal Control II
  with keyboard only. Most keyboards have a limit on simultaneous key presses that
  is much too low for the number of keys Crystal Control II would require (which
  means that key presses would be dropped randomly and create unfair matches).
  .
  Solo Mode, however, is playable with either a gamepad or a keyboard.

  constantly update my devlog and the official twitter Originally, this was known

  You don't know who they are or what they want. You just know you're the only

  these Cycle's you'll figure it out. Until then, you can only keep dying.

  possible configurations, customise your ship and master new tactics to live just

  A Mystery Unfolds
  .
  When the latest exhibit of the New Magma City Art Museum has its grand opening,
  it doesn't take long until people are going missing. And new, undocumented
  paintings start showing up in the collection... so well made, it feels like you
  could get lost in those worlds forever.
  .
  When the ordinary New Magma City penguin police force can't make nor heads nor
  tails out of this supernatural case, the ragtag band of teenage private
  investigators over at Daemon Detectives, Inc. gets called in to save the day
  once again!
  .
  Fight Your Inner Daemons
  .
  Daemon Detective Gaiden 2 is an action platformer where you fight enemies and
  jump your way through obstacles, trying to not only make your way to the finish
  line with your hide intact, but also retrieve as many of the hidden paintings in
  each world as humanly possible.
  .
  Coins obtained in the levels can be spent on a variety of powerups to help even
  the odds, and every character has an unique ability that alters their gameplay
  style drastically.

  As you defeat the bosses of each world, you gradually piece together not only
  the final boss' lair, but also the dark history behind its creation...

  Break the Sound Barrier
  .
  A spin-off crossover racing game featuring your favorite characters from Daemon
  Detective, Shattered World, Gun Princess, and Final Columbus. Travel at speeds
  over 200 mph on futuristic twisted racetracks hovering miles above massive
  megacities, cursed ruins, untamed wildernesses, and abstract otherworlds!
  .
  Chain together jump boosts and slide boosts to keep your momentum going, or use
  silly cartoon weapons to swipe victory at the last second! Try your best to stay
  on the track - easier said than done - and use the power of gravity to reach
  unfathomable speeds! Are you the fastest detective alive? There's only one way
  to find out!
  .
  Features
  .
  '90s style arcade racing without cutscenes, long loading times, or
  microtransactions!
  .
  5 cups for a total of 30 racetracks! Revisit classic areas like Crystal Tokyo
  Zone, the Painted Shadow Gallery, or Dracula's Clock Tower in glorious low-poly
  3D!
  .
  Support for local multiplayer with up to 4 players at once!
  .
  30 playable characters with different stats! Pick the character that matches
  your playstyle the best, or just roll with someone you think looks cool!
  .
  Adaptive AI that gives you a fair chance, but still will give you a run for your
  money if you're going for that elusive gold medal!
  .
  Use XInput gamepads out of the box with no setup required! Or cram 4 players
  around the same keyboard for an awkward, sweaty experience!
  .
  Skill-based, momentum-based gameplay that lets you avoid all weapons if you're
  good enough at dodging, and hit speeds much higher than your normal max speed if
  you're good at chaining boosts together!
  .
  You can move so fast you don't even need to drive on the track anymore! It was
  always more of a recommendation than a rule, anyway.
  .
  N64/PS2-style low-poly graphics in smooth 60fps!
  .
  You can play as Dracula or a penguin!
  .
  Nice music!
  .
  Actual sound effects!
  .
  I ran out of cool stuff to put on this list!

description:
  This game lets you try on the role of a Supernatural Newspaper Agency boss and
  editor. The world it takes place in is a dark and haunted one, with ghosts,
  zombies, monsters and even shapeshifting murderers, pretending to be human after
  they have stolen their victims' bodies or infiltrated the humanity. It was
  inspired heavily by the works of H.P.Lovecraft and it builds on the atmosphere
  of uncertainty and noir of the 1940s.
  .
  Send your sextet of weathered journalists, detectives and occult specialists to
  investigate murder, affair, and horror in the Town.
  .
  Each time, the story will be different. Sometimes, a werewolf is shredding
  innocent (and less innocent) victims to pieces and it is your task to unmask the
  creature. Other times, it will be a body stealing alien from outer space, a
  mummy that some misfortunate archeologist has excavated and is now haunting
  them. Perhaps it will be Jack the Ripper, still mysteriously alive and lurking
  in the streets at night.
  .
  Or maybe there is a really bad big tentacled monster hidden in the cellar of the
  University?
  .
  It is for you to find out and entertain your readers while bravely standing up
  against ancient evil.

  The time has come. Step out from the shadows to face this new enemy in open
  battle.
  .
  Soon the A.I. will have to learn how dangerous the Scavengers are.
  .
  The evil A.I. brings doom upon the world. A group of outcasts - the Scavengers -

  full of great treasures... or broken scrap.
  .

  forgotten scrap hunter. Choose your path wisely - bigger risks means bigger
  reward!

  to your individual needs using the crafting system.
  .
  Unexpected item combinations to discover during your adventures. Design your
  perfect strategy by many trials and errors, obviously resulting in many deaths.

  decide!

  and bosses. Choose from a large selection of 30+ various weapons, 50+ active and

  Five players take on the roles of the crew of the Triton, an ill-fated cargo
  ship alone in dark space.

  The captain, the doctor, the mercenary, the corpo, the synth - one of you is a

description:
  The year is 1995, and you're newly single, ready to mingle... and fresh off the
  plane in Stradania, the dysfunctional micronation whose chief exports are pig
  iron, human misery, and radioactive souvenir mugs.
  .
  Your travel guides have steered you to the hottest nightclub in town. Now it's
  up to you to seize the evening by getting up close and intimate with Stradania's
  Most Eligible Vaguely Handsome Self-Absorbed Guys You Happened to Spot in the
  Club:
  .
  Dan - Half man, half existential crisis; subsists on a steady diet of Rimbaud,
  imported cigarettes, and unmarked pills.
  .
  Fixer - The kind of person whose opinions have opinions. Don't get him started
  on data tapes - you'll be there all night.
  .
  Sandman - Mysterious hacker of few words and even fewer discernible emotions.
  Smells vaguely of anti-flea shampoo.
  .
  Shitparade - The leading authority on terrible VR trips, forever on the lookout
  for somebody to inflict them on.
  .
  NoK00l - Stradania's techwear king. Once spent a month's salary on a package of
  "tactical socks," a fact he still brags about.
  .
  Jack - Your friendly neighborhood bartender, always ready with a word of
  encouragement and a novelty cocktail. Oddly unfazed by his club's creepy decor.
  .
  Dates & Wires is the official otome spin-off of weekly webcomic Drugs & Wires,
  featuring the music of NINGEN.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  6 available dates with multiple possible endings and unlockable souvenirs
  .
  2 - 3 hours of playtime, with more than 25,000 words of dialogue
  .
  Hidden scenes, dialogue, and more depending on play order and choices - multiple
  playthroughs recommended!
  .
  Gender-neutral protagonist
  .
  RATING & CONTENT
  .
  Dates & Wires is rated PG-13 for minor language and drug references, mild
  suggestive content, and general cynicism.
  .
  Also contains harsh experimental noise and two minor jump scare-ish moments.
  .
  TIPS FOR FIRST-TIME PLAYERS
  .
  The order in which you choose to tackle the dates will have long-term effects on
  dialogue, scenes, and options - don't be afraid to save and experiment a little
  to see what happens.
  .
  There are seven unlockable souvenirs in the game, six of which are obtained from
  the main characters' best endings. The seventh? You might need to be a little
  cruel for that one...

  My name is Andrew Armstrong from Fermenter. We've just released my debut game,
  David, a physics-based platforming boss-fighter, on Windows and Mac (and iOS

  fun!
  .
  (Find this info and more at http://www.fermentergames.com/david)
  .
  You play David, an awfully small abstracted chosen hero tossed into a blissfully
  simple world overrun by giant culminations of evil physics-beasts (largely
  inspired by Shadow of the Colossus). As David, you are given a slingshot-esque
  gift that you will have to use to conquer these colossus foes. Hold, aim, and
  fling to attack (Angry Birds style!).

genre: Platformer;Adventure
description:
  Daydreamour is an extremely short (~15 mins) platformer about a developer
  daydreaming about running. Jump and climb your way through a perilous factory!
  .
  This game was made for the Locally Sourced Spring Bundle in ~5 days using Unity.
  This game is now free that the bundle is over. The small QOL updates are on hold
  until further notice.
  .
  Story:
  .
  Struggling with a creative block, the developer needed something to jump-start
  their drive again. With a sigh, they opened a new tab in their browser and began
  scrolling through videos - something they usually do when they can't make any
  progress.
  .
  While watching a video, they noticed a peculiar parkour video being recommended.
  Curious, they pulled up the video. It was someone running through a factory,
  jumping off walls and avoiding dangerous, forgotten machinery with jumps of
  precision and timing. They were astounded by the prowess of the runner in the
  video.
  .
  Going down a rabbit hole of parkour videos, the developer could feel the
  creativity rushing in. Ideas of parkour filled their head and, like that, they
  got trapped in a state of daydreaming.

  What Happens When We Die?
  .
  Is death really as it seems?
  .
  What if we had the wrong idea?
  .
  What if death wasn't death at all?
  .
  When a visit to the island's mansion turns out to be much more than our
  protagonist bargains for, discover what happens in the aftermath, uncover a
  nefarious secret, and earn an audience with the prestigious lord of the estate.
  .
  Explore The Island
  .
  Explore the island to find curiosities. Experiment to discover their purpose.
  Search the island for a way into the mansion. Talk to people and get to know
  them (or don't, it's up to you.) Who you choose to interact with can change the
  way the game unfolds. There is more than one way to approach this story, and
  more than one tale to be told.
  .
  Discover Curious Creatures
  .
  During your journey you'll encounter a variety of strange and wonderful
  creatures to interact with. Some might be friendly, others might be afraid of
  you, and others still can be dangerous if handled the wrong way. But if you take
  the time to observe them, you might learn a thing or two, and get to know them
  better.
  .
  Characters:
  .
  Darling
  .
  Darling is the main protagonist of the story. After a lengthy preparation
  period, he arrives as a new resident to the island, ready to begin a meaningful
  chapter in his life together with his wife Madeline in their new seaside home.
  But things turn out a bit differently than either of them planned, and a note
  left by Madeline is the start of an unbelievable chain of events...
  .
  Berta
  .
  The proprietress of the local tavern, Berta's meals are popular with residents
  of the island and visitors alike. There's never a slow day at her tavern, and
  she does what she can for those in need. Though, she has been known to take on
  more than she can reasonably handle sometimes.
  .
  Trudy
  .
  Trudy is the headmistress at the only schoolhouse on the island. It is her joy
  teaching children, and she makes the most of every day watching them learn and
  grow. But due to recent occurrences on the island, she and the children have
  lost their access to the school. To make matters worse, now she is being forced
  to tutor the son of the person who caused all this!
  .
  Mindy
  .
  Mindy runs an herbalism practice on the island, as well as a storefront for a
  variety of flora. Effectively she's the island's naturopathic (and only) doctor.
  When dire circumstance begins befalling the residents of the island, Mindy
  discovers she has lost access to her supply of medicines.
  .

genre: Puzzle
description:
  You've just gotten a new job!
  .
  Yes, you're the new apprentice for Death. The Grim Reaper.
  .
  It's your job to help gather souls. Only thing is, you can't just go and kill
  people to get their souls, it has to look natural, like an accident! And you can
  make this job in a very fun way, using amazing powers to do things like flood
  places, turn machines on and off, create dangerous chemical reactions and much
  more. That means for example setting up bottles, knives, brooms, and other
  regular objects in such a way as to create deadly (as well as amusing) chain
  reactions.
  .
  The Death's Life features a series of challenging puzzle in different daily
  situations. To advance in the game you must find and interact with the objects
  in the scene to solve the puzzle, triggering a sequence of events and causing
  the "accidental" death of your victims.
  .
  Try a day in Death's Life. Dying has never been more fun!

  .
  Deck Defenders is a Card Based Tower Defense game.
  .
  Place your towers, upgrade them with your Elemental and Powerup cards and get
  rid of all those pesky monsters that are trying to destroy the Mother Cube!
  .
  Make your own deck with your favorite cards out of the currently available 15
  cards.
  .
  Also suggest any improvements and let's make a list of features the community
  might want!
  .
  Visit the subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/CardDefense/
  .
  Main features:
  .
  * 15 Cards and ease to add more
  .
  * 6 fully working levels with different and interesting designs
  .
  * Easy to create new levels if you guys want more (I can create 2   levels in
  about 6 hours total)
  .
  * Tutorial
  .
  * Full camera controls (use your three mouse buttons and WASD and arrows at any
  time, press SPACE to reset the camera)
  .
  The future features look a little like this:
  .
  Full fledged level editor including: Wave editor, Terrain editor, Level
  structure editor (where the monsters walk through, etc)
  .
  Avatars and Clans have effect on gameplay. Perhaps also add relics/drops.
  .
  More cards
  .
  New graphics for cards and everything else
  .
  Full encyclopedia explaining everything about the game
  .
  Inter-user level sharing, perhaps through Steamworks or an in-game system.
  .
  Extra tower models I already have so the tower powers increase beyond the
  current ones with more interesting special effects.
  .
  Thank you for buying and playing my game. My idea is to invest all the money the
  game makes back into development.
  .

  Dee Dum is a 2D puzzle game with a simple premise - both characters move and
  jump at the same time, but their homes are in different spots.
  .
  As the home locations move and the world around them grows larger, the
  possibilities for brain-tickling puzzles become endless.
  .
  The in-browser version is just a demo - the first five levels to whet your
  appetite.
  .
  The full version includes 75 levels that will truly challenge your puzzle game
  playing prowess.  Can you beat them all?  Can you even unlock them all?
  .
  The (free)  mobile version has a bunch of in-app-purchases like hearts and level
  packs.  This has none of that nonsense.  It's a pure puzzle game where you have
  to get better to unlock the harder levels.
  .
  Note: If the game does well (greater than $100 across all platforms), level
  packs with new mechanics will be released.  Your purchase of this version makes
  you eligible for receiving future level packs for free.

  "As debut efforts go, Dj Vu is a great go of it. The puzzle designs are unique
  and well thought out, and the cloning mechanic adds a great twist to the rule-
  set that requires forward thinking in ways other titles in the genre haven't
  needed before."
  .
  Xbox Tavern
  .
  "Finally, Danielle and Eric decided that the pice de rsistance was cloning.....
  Oh developers, you know how to make a man work for his game completion. This
  last element was a masterstroke, and it made me think outside of the box. You
  must think several moves ahead, inputting the path you wish your clones to take.
  Once you are ready, you set them on their way, all while you try to progress
  through the stage."
  .

  .
  "It's these tricks which Dj Vu keeps hidden until the right time, which puts an
  unexpected twist on the puzzling action to keep things fresh and interesting. It
  feels original, innovative and is well-paced"

genre: Meditation
description:
  Desert Mothers is a multiplayer virtual reality meditation circle. Players begin
  in the same procedurally-generated environment.  This diverges for each as their
  personal environment, composed of individualized weather and hallucinations,
  responds emotionally to the player's actions.
  .
  The constraints within which the players interact are discovered during play,
  and revolve around the body, simulated breath, drawing in the air, and out-of-
  body exploration of flora, fauna, and abandoned human habitations.
  .
  "El ambiente que se logra nos pone a prueba, nos exige que reelaboremos
  continuamente nuestra relación con el espacio y el tiempo, nos sugieren que la
  meditación y la introspección establece una nueva relación con el afuera y
  pueden efectivamente cambiarlo." - Guido Saá, Game On exhibition catalog
  .
  ("The environment that is achieved puts us to the test, it requires us to rework
  continuously our relationship with space and time, they suggest that meditation
  and introspection establishes a new relationship with the outside and can
  effectively change it.")
  .
  Virtual reality version requires Windows with Oculus Rift and Touch controllers,
  or Quest. It has not been tested on Quest 2 so I'd appreciate feedback!
  .
  Non-VR version requires an XBoxOne/360 controller.

  Detective Bot is primed and ready to solve the world's hardest mysteries like
  where did Jeff leave his toy boat? Honestly it has been missing for about a week
  now and he starting to get really upset. I saw him crying in the break room,
  it's pretty bad.
  .
  FEATURES:
  .
  Play Together
  .
  Get together with up to 3 of your friends and cosy up on the couch for hilarious
  crime solving adventures. Each of you will take control of one of Detective
  Bot's limbs and together you will have to use your brains to solve some
  challenging cases. Or play singleplayer for a greater challenge where you have
  to control Detective Bot all by yourself!
  .
  Unique Physics Gameplay
  .
  Detective Bot is controlled by moving his limbs individually which if you think
  about it is actually the most realistic way to control a character that has ever
  been done in a videogame. Bold of us to push gaming into the future you say. Why
  yes it is! On your adventures you will encounter all kinds of contraptions and
  objects for Detective Bot to play with which will result in silly and fun
  physics interactions that you won't be able to get enough of.
  .
  Become a Detective
  .
  This game isn't just about silly physics it's also about Detective stuff too.
  You will have to solve some really tough mysteries but don't worry you have a
  bunch of tools at your disposal, you can question witness, look around for clues
  and build up a case against the bad guys using your detective board.
  .
  Wear a Hat
  .
  Yes! We have done it, people thought it would be impossible but through our
  innovative and ground breaking technology we will allow you to select and wear
  hats! Thank you, thank you, no need to to congratulate me... Wait you're
  offering me knighthood? Well I'm so very honoured... And Time's person of the
  year? AND a Nobel prize? I couldn't really but I will of course accept all these
  recognitions of my success because I do deserve them

developer: Tea-Powered Games
publisher: Tea-Powered Games
genre: Visual Novel;Interactive Fiction
description:
  Dialogue: A Writer's Story is a PC/Mac game about conversations, writing and
  science. In Dialogue, you play out a year in the life of Lucille, a writer
  working on her science fantasy novel, whose content is highly inspired by her
  neighbour Adrian's research subject, biochemistry.
  .
  The game consists of various types of conversations with different mechanics.
  Active conversations occur in real-time, and the effect of Lucille's statements
  can be modified through her equipped Focus. Exploratory conversations map
  different subjects spatially, allowing for backtracking and finding new paths,
  while emails can be arranged and edited.
  .
  Dialogue combines ease and depth of play to provide a well-rounded narrative
  experience grounded in everyday life. The game is fully voice acted, with a
  relaxing soundtrack and European cartoon-inspired characters. A playthrough of
  Dialogue takes around 3-6 hours.
  .
  The story in Dialogue is grounded in real life challenges and tensions, telling
  the story of relatable but interesting characters. We have drawn from our
  personal experiences to talk about the difficulties involved in two major areas.
  .
  The first is the creative process, both in Lucille's writing of her novel, and
  other people's reactions to it. The player will have insight into Lucille's
  struggles and triumphs as she changes characters, creates twists in the story
  and struggles to find a satisfying conclusion.
  .
  The second is how real scientific research is carried out, how it is seen by
  people outside of the research community. Adrian's year is focused on working
  with his unruly cells, and the player will get to experience the worries and
  joys of being a researcher.
  .
  Hey Poor Player - "True to its name, it boasts the most comprehensive dialogue
  system I've ever seen in a game... In Dialogue, understanding and empathizing
  with people is very much an end in itself. ...I found myself wanting to be more
  like Lucille - someone genuinely interested in people and their complex
  personalities."
  .
  VideoGamer - "There's a nice mingling of science and creativity, and it realises
  the process of sieving information to get to the nuggets of interesting and
  imaginative things remarkably well."
  .
  Fuwa Novel - "Dialogue: A Writer's Story is probably the best depiction of what
  it's like to be a writer you'll ever find in games."
  .
  Dialogue is the inaugural game of Tea-Powered Games. As a company, we focus on
  expanding the narrative vocabulary of digital games, both in terms of stories
  and mechanics, with a holistic design approach. Tea-Powered Games was founded by
  a writer (Flo) and designer (Des) who had been making games and writing stories
  during their research jobs.
  .
  You can find more about Dialogue at the Tea-Powered Games website. Dialogue is
  also available from Steam. You can contact Tea-Powered Games via twitter,

  Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor is an anti-adventure game about picking up trash
  in an alien bazaar. Play as the Janitor, an Alaensee girlbeast with a
  municipally-subsidized trash incineration job and dreams of leaving the planet
  of Xabran's Rock far behind her.
  .
  Explore the Spaceport! Navigate the maze of alleyways, side streets, plazas, and
  bridges as you search for discarded items to burn. Investigate one of various
  entrances to the mysterious subterranean sewerdungeon, or climb the ominously
  symmetrical Ziggurat to get a better view of the urban landscape! If you pay
  attention and keep track of landmarks, you won't get lost... probably.
  .
  Embrace routine! Spend your days cleaning up litter, finding food, and testing
  your luck at lottoshrines scattered throughout the area. Daily tasks form the
  backbone of your life as the Janitor, providing structure and monotonous
  security in an uncertain world! Do not deviate from your routine. Pray, work,
  eat, sleep. Do not deviate from your routine.
  .
  Suffer the Curse! Stick your scentflaps where you shouldn't, and you may just
  walk away with an ancient cranial entity haunting your every waking moment!
  Consult local Necresses, pray to the Nine Goddesses, purchase ritual objects,
  and rub the giant sword to balance your personal luck favorably! Maybe that will
  make the whispering stop!
  .
  Embark on an anti-adventure! Find a middle ground between your life of menial
  drudgery and a culture of exciting quests and powerful heroes, and you might

  .
  About the game, the ramble-y, not so formal version:
  .
  ( Feel free to skip to the short version if you're short on time or already know
  what the game is about.)
  .
  Discsphere is an easy-to-learn sports game where your objective is to throw a
  sphere at your opponent. The catch? You have to capture 3 goals with discs
  before you can throw spheres. You can also throw power discs on a cooldown timer
  to stun your opponent, or to remove ownership of an opponent's goal.
  .
  Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the dodge rolls, activated by tapping
  a movement key in multiplayer and by pressing the dedicated dodge roll key in
  single-player.
  .
  Did I mention the game has a single-player mode? It has a single-player mode.
  The single-player mode has a story and boss battles, and even has two final
  bosses depending on how you go about defeating the bosses.
  .
  Oh yeah, when you first play the game, please play the tutorial first! The game
  does not play very conventionally, so you'll need to understand how everything
  works before you begin! Even if you remap the controls, that won't really
  explain everything there is to know.
  .
  About the game, the short, somewhat more formal version:
  .
  ( Feel free to skip right to downloading the game if you already know what the
  game is about.)
  .
  Discsphere is a sports game about capturing goals which also has elements of
  dodgeball. The game has a conventional multiplayer mode and a boss-battle-
  focused unconventional single-player mode, which both have slightly different
  controls. Playing the tutorial before playing the game for your first time is
  recommended. Just remapping the controls isn't enough to understand how
  everything works here.
  .
  The obligatory features list:
  .
  Single-player and multiplayer modes!
  .
  Keyboard controls with support for remapping!*
  .
  A dedicated dodge roll button, only in the single-player mode!**
  .
  Two ways to win: Hit your opponent with a sphere, or have more goals than your
  opponent when times runs out!
  .
  Multiple stage layout options in multiplayer, including the option to randomly
  cycle between stages after every point scored!
  .
  Several songs, randomly cycled in the multiplayer mode and carefully picked to
  be relevant in the single-player mode!***
  .
  You play as a knight in the single-player mode!! I mean, why not!!!
  .
  Boss battles!
  .
  A sort of overworld segment thing for the single-player mode between the boss
  battles! This gives you a breather between bosses.
  .
  Two final bosses, the arguably harder one requiring you to win by time against
  every boss in the game!
  .
  A generally speaking highly experimental design!
  .
  You can turn off music with Control+M! (You can't un-mute it immediately but
  Shift+M will make music play once more the next time the game changes scenes.)
  .
  *There are programs out there if you need to play this with a controller. Sorry,
  good controller support is really hard to code and even harder to code for more
  than one player with the engine I'm using in mind. ;_;
  .
  Game development can be hard,,,
  .
  **I didn't think to add this until part-way through the game's development and
  with how the keyboard remapping works, it would've been difficult to add this
  .
  ***Some of the songs only play in the single-player mode.
  .
  A note from the developer:
  .
  Hey guys, this is a note from Adam. Not going to be joking around quite as much
  as I did with most of the rest of this page. Maybe I'll throw in a joke or two
  for those of you who otherwise might not read something like this.
  .
  First of all, thanks for considering playing my game. It does mean something to
  me. ^_^
  .
  Second off, I made this game because another project of mine was... well, it was
  going well, technically speaking. But I needed a break. I burned myself out on
  it. So to take my mind off of all of that, I kind of just sat back somewhat
  unproductively. But then an idea for a sports video game popped into my head.
  .
  Which is strange, sports video games aren't usually exactly a genre I see myself
  playing much. But the idea sounded like fun, and sounded simple enough to make,
  so I set out to make it. And here we are now.
  .
  Honestly, most of the time went into making the single-player mode. Most of the
  multiplayer content was done less than a week after the game's development
  started, and the last-minute addition of alternate stage layouts only took maybe
  15 minutes of work.
  .
  Despite that, I really hope you can give both the single-player and the
  multiplayer a fair shake. The game was designed for multiplayer first and
  foremost, with the single-player coming later. If you don't have somebody to
  play with locally, there's programs out there for playing local multiplayer
  games in online multiplayer.
  .
  If you need help finding such a program, well, might I recommend Parsec?
  http://parsecgaming.com
  .
  Anyways, because this game is so experimental in its design, I didn't wanna
  charge people up-front for the game. I don't know who this game is for, if
  anybody, and I don't feel like anybody will know for sure until they've already
  played it. To that end, you can download the game for free. I recommend you do
  so at first. I don't want you to feel ripped off.
  .
  However, if you like the game, a donation would be appreciated. $1 if you feel
  like you got some fun out of it, and $5 if you feel like you really liked it,
  sounds like a fair value to me, but feel free to go higher or lower as you wish.
  Just... please don't over-do it, only put in the money if you can actually
  afford it!
  .
  Whatever the case may be, regardless of whether you put in money or not, I hope
  you enjoy the game! ^v^
  .
  ~Adam
  .
  Extra stuff for paying more:
  .
  If you put in $5, you get an added bonus in the form of high and low quality
  soundtrack downloads! The MP3 version sounds incredibly wrong though, it's
  mostly included as a joke, I recommend using the OGG soundtrack for most
  purposes and the FLAC soundtrack if you don't mind downloading a larger file
  like that. There's also a file included that includes every version of the
  soundtrack, just in case you were hoping to download them all anyways.
  .
  There aren't any incentives for paying any more than that (at least, not yet),
  but as I said earlier, feel free to pay more if you want to!
  .
  One last thing of note:
  .
  We also have a press kit available for the game. Currently, you can download it
  in ZIP format here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJw2xDFJ1hoYJHvpZ-

description:
  Following a bizarre cataclysmic event that cracked the moon in half, the Earth
  is struggling with the environmental fallout. Everything is already dead or
  dying... except you. Or so you think. Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive is a post-
  apocalyptic thriller from veteran developer Scriptwelder, creator of the popular
  horror series Deep Sleep and Don't Escape. Players must figure out a way to
  properly fortify their home against each night's new danger, as they learn the
  truth behind the apocalypse and search for a way to safety, if one exists.
  .
  Players will journey alongside David, a lone survivor after the end of the
  world, who finds himself having prophetic dreams... or nightmares. Each chapter
  of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous fog
  or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a result,
  you'll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs. But you don't
  have forever. Certain actions advance the in-game clock, and you'll need to
  complete your preparations to (hopefully) stay alive before night falls.
  .
  Will you make it through all four days? Will your companions?
  .
  Features:
  .
  A classic pixelart aesthetic and creepy atmosphere from a veteran of horror and
  thrillers.
  .
  Logical puzzles and exploration to challenge players without frustrating them.
  .
  Time mechanics; certain actions advance the clock in a race against time.
  .
  A post-apocalyptic thriller, with an engaging storyline and cast.
  .
  Moody and engrossing original musicial score.
  .
  Multiple variations for each chapter mean multiple playthroughs with new
  content.

  About the Developer:
  .
  Poland-based developer Scriptwelder is a well known creator of creepy web-based
  games, perhaps the most iconic of which is the Deep Sleep series, which has won
  multiple awards and been played by millions all around the world. The Don't
  Escape series began as a web game that inverted the classic escape-the-room
  formula... rather than trying to find a way out, players were instead trying to
  find a way to secure themselves within, usually from some sort of threat or
  danger. Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive is his first full length premium game.

  You're a college freshman with college freshman problems: you've got an awful
  professor, your roommate's kind of a flake, and this week really just hasn't
  been going your way.  Luckily, you've got just the thing planned for this
  weekend: a night in the woods with the girl you've been (sorta?) seeing and your
  new (sorta?) friends.  But things are never that easy.  As you receive strange
  phone calls and hear concerning noises from beyond the treeline, tensions arise
  in your small camp, and choices must be made that will determine your fate...
  or, at least, the fate of your relationships with your friends.
  .
  Don't Take it Personally, I Just Don't Like You is a lo-fi relationship dramedy
  about camping illegally on government property in the chill of early autumn,
  having public anxiety attacks in crowded shopping malls, the people we choose to
  be with, and what we do when they don't choose us back.  In this demo, you'll be
  introduced to several characters and locations from the full game (including two
  romanceable characters!) in a fully self-contained, hour-long story.
  .
  Demo Features:
  .
  Play as a guy, gal, or non-binary pal.
  .
  Go on a camping trip with two of your friends (I heard one of them likes you!)
  .
  Four different endings.
  .
  Listen to some chill beats by Lofi Dreams.
  .
  Share your deepest fears.
  .
  Drink in the woods and plan the fall of capitalism.

  ABOUT
  .
  This is the original Prototype game idea for Dorfromantik created in April 2020
  for Ludum Dare 46. This free prototype got submitted and accepted for the
  "Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality" as a free game.
  .
  Dorfromantik is a peaceful building strategy and puzzle game where you create a
  beautiful and ever-growing village landscape by placing tiles.
  .
  After getting lots of positive feedback we decided to start working on a full
  game based on this game idea. The full game DORFROMANTIK was released on Steam
  and GOG on March 25th 2021 by our newly formed studio Toukana - you can download
  our Presskit HERE. If you like the Dorfromantik Prototype and would like to stay

  This is a game called "Down to Earth" (named after the theme of the game jam)
  created in 7 days, if you want to see it expanded and turned into a full game
  definitely leave a comment below!
  .
  I made all the pixel art and models myself using Blender and Piskel, I also
  created the soundtrack during the timeframe of the game jam using Ableton Live,
  it is included in a folder named "MUSIC" so definitely check that out.
  .
  Some of the textures are from the startup content that I modified and also a
  couple sound effects are from a royalty free website called soundbible. If you
  want to see my other work check out http://www.luxireally.com or

  Compare Your Morals Update
  .
  You can now compare what you think is the "correct" decision to thousands of
  other players. Are they wrong? Are you wrong? You can now see stats on decisions
  you make in-game. We want to know which ones players agreed on and which ones
  generated differences in opinion.
  .
  We also added more problems for you to address! 20 new dilemmas which will get
  you thinking what should I do? More moral problems! We've added more scenarios
  where you have to make tough choices about what's right and what's wrong, so
  that we can keep expanding on this aspect of gameplay and give you more
  difficult decisions to make.
  .
  We also care about privacy, so we had to build our own custom system to track
  all the trolley problems.
  .
  We're committed to making sure that our trolley problem game is as safe and
  secure as possible-we don't track or store any personal information about our
  users. Only you see your decisions and how you compare to others. When you make
  a decision it's recorded anonymously without any data attached to you.
  .
  The 2020 Retrospective Update
  .
  The game includes the 2020 Retrospective update!
  .
  The Base Game
  .
  Dr. Trolley's Problem brings the classic philosophical quandaries of The Trolley
  Problem to life and asks you to make life or death decisions on the fly. Explore
  your moral fiber in ways you never imagined (or asked for)!
  .
  Dr. Trolley is an infamous robot mad scientist from another dimension which has
  sequestered you in its simulation to answer the most pressing questions:
  .
  Should humans be allowed to drive cars? Or would driving (and most other things)
  be safer in the hands of Artificial Intelligence?
  .
  Along the way Dr. Trolley will probe all the classic philosophical quandaries of
  The Trolley Problem. You'll be asked life or death decisions on the fly. You'll
  explore your moral fibre in ways you never imagined (or asked for). You'll find
  out what your friends are made of. And you'll help Dr. Trolley decide if you're
  capable of making any decisions at all!
  .
  Prepare earn your PhD in Trolleyology!
  .
  This game is game made for the love of The Trolley Problem and all the weird and
  wonderful questions it makes you ask about yourself. We thought it would be fun
  to develop a platform for extending the Trolley Problem in all directions. We
  eventually want to collect accurate statistics about the choices people make
  (de-identified data, of course) so users can see what choices other people made
  in the strange situations the game presents. We'd also like to add new
  situations over time, possibly themed in interesting ways.
  .
  Currently the game includes 50 ethical situations that last anywhere from 30
  seconds to one minute each. Some situations involve reading what is presented on
  screen. Within each situation the player decides whether or not to act to save a
  character (or not).
  .
  Consider your philosophy.

  .
  This is a small platform game starring our little pixel hero, Drake. This
  version is the full game. Purchasing the game will give you a downloadable
  version that you can keep forever.
  .
  The downloadable version comes in two flavors. A Windows executable for all
  modern flavors of windows, and a flash version that should work in any browser
  running flash.
  .
  PLEASE NOTE: The flash version has been discontinued due to the closure of Adobe
  Flash Player in modern web browsers.  I will not be updating it, but I will keep
  the version 1.0 flash game available for purchase and play for those without
  windows or on older systems.  So far the only missing features in the flash
  version are the pause and file select screens, so it's still very much enjoyable
  if you can run it.  Please remember to check your system to make sure you can
  run old flash games before purchasing if you don't have windows! - 12/12/2020
  .
  You will also get these:
  .
  No "please support" screen at start of game.
  .
  Pause game with P, and exit a stage in progress. (Windows version only, sorry.)
  .
  Play offline without any internet.
  .
  Keep a copy of Drake forever.
  .
  You can contact Gawain Doell at darkgrif@gmail.com with any feedback or support
  issues! I will also check in on the page comments if you prefer to leave some
  public feedback others can read!

  Updates:
  .
  12/25/2020
  .
  Minor update to 1.2 with a major fix for false positive antivirus detection.
  The game has been built with a new version of Clickteam Fusion that should
  correct the false positive detection from a lot of antivirus software.  If you
  had trouble downloading the windows version before, try version 1.2.  There are
  no other changes in this update.
  .
  12/12/2020
  .
  Update for 2020!
  .
  First the bad news, the flash version will be discontinued.  It is still
  playable on older systems, but modern web browsers don't like flash.  So I can't
  support it anymore moving forward.  It just takes too much time for me to test
  on windows and flash versions, so I will focus only on the Windows platform from
  now on.
  .
  Now some good news!  Drake for windows now has a file select screen!  Saves can
  be erased in game as well, so now you can truly restart the game and play again
  or speed run to your heart's content!
  .
  4/3/2017
  .
  Release of version 1.0. All game levels are included in both the web game and
  the downloadable version. If you buy the download version by donating you can
  play it offline and keep Drake forever.

  Drive to Hell is an action-packed shooter where you'll take a ride through an
  army of monsters to exact revenge on the Demon King for destroying your favorite
  dive bar.

  .

  4 Difficulty Settings, challenging beginners and experts alike
  .
  Endless Survival Mode
  .
  Over a Dozen Powerups & Weapons
  .
  Hordes of Deadly Monsters, including 5 Bosses
  .

  .
  Trophy System with a reward for completion
  .
  Original Soundtrack
  .
  3 Control Options (keyboard/keyboard & mouse/controller)
  .
  Customizable Options for Sound & Display
  .
  Drive to Hell is a Shoot 'Em Up game at heart, but it plays a little differently
  than usual. Enemies spawn from random locations outside the screen area, making
  the center of the screen your friend. This puts more pressure on players to
  utilize the entire screen in their playing style (rather than hanging out at the
  bottom/back of the play field which is typical in many other shooters), making
  the smart use of hard braking, Nitros, etc. key.
  .
  Drive to Hell also uses grounded vehicles rather than aerial, so you will have
  to take water obstacles, walls, etc. into consideration as well as your vehicle
  choice - trucks and armored cars aren't impeded by liquids (the hovercraft
  actually gains speed!) but they will have tougher time dodging enemy fire.
  .
  Each vehicle has a unique appearance and set of stats determining firing power,
  special attack duration, health, and size as well as its own personal special
  attack that works either offensively or defensively. This allows you to choose
  the perfect one for your play style, whether it's flying around the screen
  quickly in a fragile indy car or bulldozing through foes with a huge armored
  car.
  .
  You can listen to the soundtrack or download the Digital Album here on our
  BandCamp page.You'll have the option to immediately download of 8-track album in
  the high-quality format of your choice (MP3, FLAC, and more), plus unlimited
  mobile access using the free Bandcamp listening app.

  .
  Will you help me connect a device?
  .
  Sorry, I don't provide support for anything besides the software itself. Before
  you purchase DrumBrain, you should ensure your peripheral is working, and
  recognized as a Game Controller (click here for details)
  .
  Will it work with [hardware/controller]?
  .
  If it's not listed above, it's not guaranteed to work. Before you purchase, make
  sure it connects to your PC and is recognized as a Game Controller (click here
  for details).
  .
  Will PS3 controllers work?
  .
  PS3 controllers may require additional 3rd party software (install at your own
  risk). I do not offer support for getting controllers setup on your computer.
  .
  Please ensure it works before purchasing!
  .
  TROUBLESHOOTING
  .
  I get an error message "The code execution cannot proceed because MSVCR110.dll
  was not found..." when I run DrumBrain.exe
  .
  This issue has been resolved, so if you are still getting it, please download
  the latest version.
  .
  I get an error message "OpenGL functions unsupported..." when I run
  DrumBrain.exe. What does this mean?
  .
  Update your video card drivers. If you've never done it, here's how.
  .
  Why do you need to do this? OpenGL drivers used to be provided with windows, but
  no longer. You must acquire them by updating your graphics adapter drivers.
  DrumBrain will work after you've done this, and you will also benefit from
  having up-to-date drivers.
  .
  When I hit a pad, there's an audible delay/latency. Can I do anything to improve
  this?
  .
  Maybe. Ensure you are using a WASAPI audio device. Go into the menu Settings >
  Audio, and test the devices under WASAPI tab. This audio API is low latency
  (high performance), but you won't be able to hear any other audio while you have
  Drum Brain using a WASAPI device.
  .
  If you still hear a noticeable delay, then your CPU may be too slow to run
  DrumBrain.

  What's Dual Pong?
  .
  Dual Pong is a skill-based 2D sports game that stays true to what made the
  original Pong game a success, while also bringing some new ideas to the table.
  .
  What Does This Game Have To Offer?
  .
  - A Story Mode with 16 possible endings
  .
  - A Singles Mode
  .
  - A Team Mode
  .
  - A Battle Mode
  .
  - A Classic Pong Mode
  .
  - An AI that can adapt to your skill level
  .
  - A dynamic ball collision system
  .
  - Versatile and responsive controls
  .
  - Multiplayer that can go up to 4 players
  .
  - And More
  .
  Note: This game can be played with a keyboard, a Xbox 360 controller, or a Xbox
  One controller.
  .
  More Info From The Game Creator
  .
  Dual Pong has a more methodical gameplay style than the original Pong game.
  Players have to focus not only on their defense, but also on their offense if
  they want to improve their chances of winning. The player's offense is
  determined by which key or button the player presses while a ball is colliding
  with their paddle. This gives the player more control over which hitting
  techniques they use in different situations during the game. The versatile
  controls in this game allow the player to control the offense in a variety of
  both familiar and unfamiliar ways. Players can choose and change up their
  controls on the fly by deciding which combination of keys or buttons they want
  to use in real-time.
  .
  With the exception of the Classic Pong game event, all of the rest of the game
  events in this game requires the player to focus their defense and offense on 2
  balls during gameplay instead of just one. This can create situations where the
  player can be on offense and defense at the same time, and it can also create
  situations where the player might be temporarily overwhelmed by 2 balls moving
  towards their side of the screen at the same time; which can possibly become
  more difficult to deal with depending on whether or not certain ball collisions
  happen during these situations. There are 16 possible ball collisions that can
  happen when the 2 balls collide with each other. These possible ball collisions
  are determined by which direction the 2 balls are moving in, and also what speed
  the 2 balls are moving at when they collide with each other. There are also
  other possible collisions that can happen (even during the Classic Pong game
  event) when a ball collides with a paddle; which can either result in the ball
  "staying in play" or "going out of play". Players will only be able to use their
  offense on a ball if it stays in play.
  .
  The AI will adapt to the player's skill level based on how well the player is
  performing in the game. Although the AI can adapt to the player's skill level,
  the AI will never become unbeatable. The player just needs to figure out a way
  to beat the AI. If the player figures out a way to beat the AI in each of the
  game events, they can choose to play against other players who have done the
  same in order to find their next level of challenge. The AI in this game is
  smart and was designed to have a similar play style to some of the players. The
  AI is also capable of making split decisions when necessary. In addition to a
  smart and adaptive AI, this game also has some hidden in-game strategies and
  easter eggs; but I want the players to discover them on their own.

  how does one discuss such a person without being exploitative? perhaps we frame
  him as a product of external forces, a war perhaps, in effect making him
  blameless. I like to remember him with the aphorism, "you can't kick every

description:
  Welcome to Dwerg Saga and a world of deep storytelling. Guide your clan of
  Dwergs as they establish a new home in the untamed wilderness. Watch as they
  forge friendships, sing tales of their forefathers, suffer the pangs of
  unrequited love, take up arms and seek adventure wherever you take them.
  .
  Inspired by Dwarf Fortress, Dwerg Saga aims to create dramatic and believable
  stories from the interactions between Dwergs, their environment and what they
  build. Dwerg Saga is being designed with usability as a key feature so it's easy
  to pick up and play.
  .
  Multiplayer games are possible on a Local Area Network (LAN). The persistent,
  shared-universe of Dwerg Saga (the Cloud Service) is currently disabled. In the
  Cloud Service, when you connect to a game, the world is specific to your real-
  world location. Other players in the same location can play in the same world at
  the same time and whatever you build will still be there when you come back to
  that location.
  .
  The Cloud Service has been disabled until funding goals are achieved.

  This game is available to $3-tier Patreon supporters.

  WELCOME TO EEK3!
  .
  After they demolished the mall, the old dirt patch on the edge of town stayed
  untended for coming up on two years. Until tonight.
  .
  On the way back from a late-night walk you passed by the familiar vacant spot -
  only to find that it was vacant no longer. A cubic monolith of glass and steel,
  stretching heavenward, stood where that morning there had been nothing. From
  within - bright lights, electric sounds, bitcrushed music. And the very faint
  echo of shrieks and moans.
  .
  It's late already. Looks like you'll be coming home a little later still...

  stuff ppl said about the games. omfg <3
  .
  "Indie game developer ceMelusine makes brief, simple games that offer the player
  poignant moments of loneliness." - Leigh Alexander (Offworld)
  .
  "As simple as the gameplay is, every time I boot it up, I find myself hypnotized
  by the atmosphere and the language. There's something about Oracle that feels
  oddly grand and ancient." - Danielle Riendeau (Polygon)
  .
  "Like the declarations of Mountain, I find the symbols and prophecies pleasing
  to contemplate; they're little focuses for reflection." - Alice O'Connor (Rock
  Paper Shotgun)
  .
  "The games juxtapose the arcane and the comfortable, asking you to find meaning
  and purpose." - Heather Alexandra (Kotaku)
  .
  But ceMelusine! I can't afford to pay for these games/am press!
  .
  That's totally cool. I still want you to play the games, so feel free to email
  me at ceMelusine (at) gmail.com and tell me which games you are interested in
  playing. I'll will totally hook you up with a copy. Also maybe follow me on the
  tweester or something (@ceMelusine).

description:
  Elden: Path of the Forgotten follows Elden's journey as they are thrust into a
  dark and dying world that they must survive. The story is inspired by my
  experiences leaving home at age of 15 and being thrust into a dark world that
  scared and confused me.
  .
  Guide Elden on a mission across a blighted land to save their mother from
  ancient horrors. Engage in brutal, technical combat and master eldritch magics
  as you walk the Forgotten Path. Elden explores non-traditional storytelling
  through indirect methods - like reading an illustrated book in a language you
  don't understand. The combat is based on reaction rather than action.
  Strategically, you will need to manage your stamina and position in order to
  master the art of parry or to find the perfect time to strike. Visually inspired
  by classic 16 and 8 bit games, Elden: Path of the Forgotten is a stunning,
  encapsulating, dark world waiting to be explored.
  .
  Figure out Elden's confusing world without guidance, tutorials, or support.
  .
  Many diverse and challenging regions.

  Horrifying Lovecraftian enemies and bosses.

genre: Application
description:
  The Electric Zine Maker is a printshop and art tool for making zines.
  .
  This tool includes a drawing interface. You can import images, size and place,
  write text with any font that you have installed, smudge, paint, and a number of
  other options. You can also save your zines, and easily re-import them by
  dragging the saved zine folder back into the main menu. It is built with
  collaboration in mind.
  .
  The Electric Zine Maker has a new beautiful website where you can learn more
  about it! Click here to visit it.
  .
  macOS users that have trouble opening the Electric Zine Maker (the file keeps
  getting blocked), please read this guide for how to open it.
  .
  Windows users that have trouble saving their Zines (or other issues) please read
  this guide.
  .
  If you liked The Electric Zine Maker please consider paying for it so I can
  cover development costs and make money from it. Thank you kindly.
  .
  The Electric Zine Maker is still under development!!!
  .
  This is an early beta.
  .
  Be gentle! It has early beta feelings!!!  !??
  .
  More art tools are being built for it.
  .
  There are a number of bugs. It is rough around a few edges.
  .
  You can read more about what is planned for it here.
  .
  The Electric Zine Maker is planned to be an "art toy". It's a playful tool with
  which you can create cute little things. The finished version will feature a
  silly little back-story, and other characters, maybe even some small game-like
  interactions to build a story around it, so that it's an all around playful
  piece of freeware.
  .
  Things planned:
  .
  * Many strange and interesting art-tools for the drawing interface
  .
  * Bugs need to be fixed and the UI's still need more work
  .
  * A back story, and little characters that reinforce the fictional universe it
  is placed in.
  .
  * A number of other art-tools (that are packaged with it), that allow you to
  create effects and glitch art for your zines.
  .
  * Clip art will be bundled with the Zine Maker so you have more art to work
  with.
  .
  Things from other devs:
  .
  * Jeremy Oduber made an html template for turning zines made with the Electric
  Zine Maker into a web ready html zine (web zines!). You can host those on itch.
  It's easy to use! Check it out: https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine

  Kind Words:
  .
  "I think that just about everything Nathalie Lawhead makes is wonderfully
  energetic, raw, and approachable. Top of the charts, for me, is their Electric
  Zine Maker project, which makes single-page-zine creation a breeze."
  .
  - by Kat Brewster on Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  "The arrival of this software into my life restored a sense of play to my
  creative practice and brought back a flame I thought had dimmed for good. It
  gave me the courage, too, to send scrappy, earnest writing to the people who
  wanted to read it, without the intense pressure of online publishing or the
  quick-fire takes of social media."
  .
  - by Sarah Maria Griffin on The Guardian
  .
  "What Lawhead and the Electric Zine Maker suggest is that seriousness is not
  always the best way to fight back against a system that doesn't care about you;
  choosing lightness, lack of coherence, silliness and restful creation can be
  just as effective."
  .
  - by Nicole Froio on The Observer
  .
  "Zines und OpenSource passen wunderbar zueinander, findet Nathalie Lawhead und
  entwickelt seit 2018 den Electric Zine Maker. Nun ist ein groes Update fr das
  Printshop-Tool erschienen."

  It's said that somewhere, hidden from all but the most determined explorers,
  there is a miniature world where one may go to escape the worries of life. After
  falling from the sky, you've found yourself in that very same miniature world.
  But now that you're there, can you ever return home again?

  reach high places, dash over seemingly bottomless pits, dive into uncharted
  waters, and lift the heaviest obstacles with ease! But beware; there are also
  strange and powerful beings in this magical world, many of whom won't give up
  their Gems willingly! It'll take all of your abilities, wits, and skill to
  gather enough Gems to reach the Tower!

developer: Quarter Onion Games, mbhahn
publisher: Quarter Onion Games, mbhahn
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Emberlight is a true roguelite dungeon crawler, set in a world where the Gods
  have given you a great gift - and a great curse.
  .
  Explore procedurally generated dungeons as a Knight of the Ember Order. Conquer
  the quests set out before your party, and uncover the lore of the land. Grow
  your strength by absorbing the abilities of your slain enemies and collecting
  the powerful traits of dungeon bosses.
  .
  Become strong, become quick, become immortal - but be warned - as you fight
  using unstable Ember powers, they will begin to corrupt and twist your very
  soul. Every gift of power has its sacrifice; every ability has its cost.
  .
  As the Gods fight for control of their creations, you must decide what is good,
  and what is evil. To protect your people against the dangers of Ember power, you
  must use its power to your advantage. Will you conquer the dark, or will you
  lose yourself to corruption?
  .
  ABSORB
  .
  As a Knight of the Ember Order, you have the ability to absorb the abilities
  used by your enemies.  Every ability used by enemies has a chance to be learned.
  This allows customization of each character towards whichever goals you have.
  But each absorbed ability has a cost...
  .
  CORRUPT
  .
  Every absorbed ability will corrupt your soul.  You will slowly lose yourself to
  evil as the quest progresses.  This expresses itself in unstable corruption
  traits which leads to metamorphosis into an evil being (such as a lich).  And
  you will lose yourself to the corruption...
  .
  REPEAT
  .
  Each run will last between 30-60 minutes.  After completing the quest, the most
  corrupted will kill off his former allies in an epic battle.  This corrupted
  being will then begin attracting evil around them, and will act as a boss in a
  future quest once their influence has expanded enough.  They will have all the
  powers you have provided them during the run, providing a never ending challenge
  in future runs.  For every corrupted boss, a stronger party is required to
  defeat them.  And the cycle repeats......forever?

  THE ENIGMA MACHINE is a short first-person science fiction horror game that aims
  to capture the obscurity and unpredictability of games of old, framed within an

  "There are some offers I can't refuse. "Would you like to poke around inside the

  A small little RPGmaker game about a lonely girl with a connection to another
  world that she sees in her dreams.
  .
  WARNING:
  .
  May contain some loud and prolonged low/high pitch moments and unsettling
  atmosphere/elements. May also contain some flashing lights moments!!
  .
  Tem here!!! It's my first time making an RPGmaker game!! Its my first time
  trying to put together my own project outside of an animated thing (though... I
  guess this is still sort of.. that..).  I've always wanted to make an RPGMaker
  game, though I guess it isn't much of a game. Its around 15-20 minutes long
  (though I guess it could be longer if you try to get all the endings).
  .
  There's around 4 different endings you can get.
  .
  A small warning that one of the endings is a little creepy/unsettling.. But
  hopefully its not too much.  Also... occasionally a movie might freeze... I'm
  not really sure what causes this, if it happens, try restarting the game. I'm
  sorry if this happens :( It seems like this has been working for some people as
  a fix, so you could give it a try! https://itch.io/t/432226/found-a-way-to-fix-
  tv-scene-crashing-bugs
  .
  Thank you for stopping by!! I hope you like it!! I'll try to make more one day.
  .
  Hopefully I set up the downloading option right where you don't have to pay for
  it. But feel free to donate if you'd like to support me!!

developer: bignastytruck (violet)
publisher: bignastytruck (violet)
genre: Simulation
description:
  Inspired by escort mission games, Escort Yourself Out asks you to help your
  childhood self navigate triggering environments. While moving through everyday
  spaces fraught with triggers, you must take action to care for yourself in order
  to navigate the situation. It is an autobiographical representation of some of
  my experiences being mentally ill.
  .
  This game discusses some of my experiences being mentally ill and dealing with
  trauma. Everybody experiences mental illness and deals with trauma differently.
  This game is meant to be representative of some parts of my experiences, and no
  one else's. I am not claiming or attempting to represent a universal experience
  of mental illness and trauma (because there isn't one), but, rather, just one
  manifestation of these things - my manifestation. Maybe our experiences look
  totally different, and that's fine. Both our experiences are valid, even if they
  look nothing alike. This game is also not an attempt to represent the whole of
  my experiences. It's just showing little parts.
  .
  Content warnings: discussion of trauma and triggers, eating disorders, OCD,
  depression, misophonia, victim-blame and self-blame. Vague mention of a specific
  childhood trauma (though no details are given, there are several common
  interpretations, most of which involve abuse of some kind). Representation of
  eating disorder-, OCD-, misophonia-, and trauma-related triggers.

  Pirin race, demigod descendants of a fairy and a mortal who live on the highest
  mountains in the east. One night, Eselmir receives a mission from his Goddess
  that could change the fate of many: to find the five lost gifts of King Theoson,
  progenitor of the Pirin civilization, who upon his death was buried together

developer: Phoebe Shalloway
publisher: Phoebe Shalloway
genre: Adventure
description:
  In a distant future in which capitalism and consumerism have continued to run
  rampant, corporations have replaced all government, and planet Earth has long
  been relegated to legend, society constantly moves to new planets and throws
  away the old ones like last year's model of smartphone.
  .
  You are a guest at the launch party for the most recently developed planet:
  Arcadia. Over the course of the evening you will wander the Arcadia Botanical
  Gardens' various rooms and eavesdrop on the other distinguished guests whose
  stories and dramas play out in a repeating cycle.
  .
  The Gardens claim to recreate the natural world of "prelaunch" Earth, a world no
  one has experienced in thousands of years. The game explores humanity's
  relationship to nature under capitalism, speculating on what "nature" would look
  when completely constructed by humans, and prompting the question of how close
  we may already be to such a reality.
  .
  I studied media studies at Vassar College, class of 2018, and this game was
  originally created as my senior thesis. You can learn more about the theory
  behind Even in Arcadia in my thesis's written component.
  .
  CONTENT WARNING:  References to drug use and suicide. Since the game is explored
  at your own pace, you can leave the conversations that reference these topics
  immediately if you encounter them and feel uncomfortable.

  "Welcome back to the Afterlife, Ki. Let's get you to the Evergate, and back to
  Earth"
  .
  When a lost soul named "Ki" awakens in the afterlife, her path back to earth is
  blocked by the 'Evergate'. To return home, Ki must decipher her mysterious
  connection to kindred spirit as she navigates through memories of a time once
  past.
  .
  Navigate through each new memory via 85 challenging stages. Harness the
  'Soulflame' mechanic, unlock new abilities and find your own creative ways to
  reach each end gate.
  .
  This ancient power of the Afterlife allows Ki to slow down time, take aim and
  fire a beam of energy at white surfaces known as "The Source".
  .
  Use your Soulflame to smash through the mysterious crystals scattered throughout
  each memory. Unleash their power to soar to new heights, reach the unreachable
  and safely navigate perilous environments. Hit multiple crystals at once to
  combined their energies and find new creative ways to reach the end gate.
  .
  Rise to the challenge and collect "Essences" by reaching all the areas within
  each memory. Use them to unlock ancient artefacts and boost Ki's attributes.
  Move faster, jump higher and harness even greater powers!
  .
  Gorgeous hand-drawn visuals and an elegantly orchestrated soundtrack - recorded
  by a live orchestra - immerse players in the Afterlife and bring dreams,
  nightmares and spirits alive in stunning detail.

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Ex Novo is a playable city-generator that helps you construct, and populate
  fictional villages, towns, and cities. This physical game can be played solo or
  with up to 3 friends. Playtime ranges from 1 to 3 hours.
  .
  Meet with your friends, and collaboratively draw the map of your city as you
  explore the history of its founding, and the forces, factions, and events that
  shape its development.
  .
  Ex Novo is both a fun game, and a tool that helps you build memorable
  settlements ready for further creative use; the cities generated can for example
  be used in any sort of narrative endeavors or as settings for pen and paper
  role-playing game adventures.
  .
  Please share your cities with us using the hashtag #ExNovoCity.
  .
  Created by Martin Nerurkar and Konstantinos Dimopoulos.
  .
  Playing Ex Novo
  .
  You (and up to three friends) take on the role of the guardian spirit of a
  freshly founded settlement. Its founding, in fact, conjured you into existence,
  and imbued you with purpose: to witness the settlement grow, shepherd its
  development, inspire its factions, and remember its stories.
  .
  During play you will make sense of the events happening as you roll dice, plan
  and draw on a collaborative map of your settlement, and influence its changing
  shape. You will flesh out a living place complete with landmarks, districts,
  resources, and people, and in the end create your own, unique, fictional town. A
  town with a true sense of history and place.
  .
  Sequence of Play
  .
  Play begins with a brief discussion phase, where each player shares their
  assumptions and expectations. The age and size of the city-to-be are also
  determined, and with them the expected duration of the game.
  .
  Next up is the founding phase. Taking turns, players define such fundamentals
  features of the settlement as the surrounding terrain or its original founding
  purpose. Every feature is described by the acting player, who will then have to
  draw it on the map. Following Ex Novo's initial sequence of turns, players will
  have an interesting starting situation in their hands.
  .
  The following phase, the development phase, is the core of the game. Each turn
  in this phase provides with an event brought forth  by the roll of three dice.
  These events need to be interpreted, and sketched by the active player. During
  the development phase the settlement will grow, change or even shrink; factions
  will rise and fall, populations will move, old neighborhoods will decline, and
  mighty edifices will be built. This is where the exciting history of your city
  will be played out, where its structure will evolve, and where the game map will
  get both bigger and richer.
  .
  The final phase is the topping out phase. These few quick turns are all that's
  needed to wrap up the development of the city, and tie up any loose ends.
  Dominant landmarks might even get named as your settlement's finishing touches
  are applied.
  .
  Finally your creation will be ready for you to admire, illustrate, show off or
  use as a jumping off point for something entirely new: a new RPG campaign, a
  video game setting, a novel fantasy or a even short story.

  CONTEXT
  .
  The year is 2221 and you are the lone technician aboard the Eye of Ra, an anti-
  asteroid space station orbiting Earth.
  .
  It has been two decades since the Apep event caused widespread disturbances
  throughout the Solar System. Ancient orbital paths and gravitational
  partnerships were forever altered, and our centuries-old knowledge of them was
  rendered unreliable. The calculated, near-zero risk of an asteroid impact on an
  inhabited world suddenly became unknown.
  .
  The Solar Union scrambled to recalculate the odds, to find lost objects before
  they could strike one of its five member worlds. Nuclear warheads were
  stockpiled and aimed at the skies of the Incorporated Planet of Mercury, the
  Republic of Mars, the Federation of Jupiter, and the Colonial Republic of Titan.
  Meanwhile, on Earth, they built something entirely new: the Ra laser. An
  orbital, Solar-powered cannon capable of reaching across the Solar System and
  removing kilometres-wide objects from existence.
  .
  The power within the Eye of Ra defends us all from the modern asteroid threat.
  The Solar Union entrusts Earth with the protection of its member worlds, who in
  turn entrusts the Eye of Ra to one technician: you.

  THE GAME
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus is a first person exploration game set in a science fiction
  future. You are a crew member of the USSC Lazarus waking up from cryo sleep
  without memories and even without name in an apparently abandoned drifting cargo
  spaceship. But you're not alone, there is also Hybris, the Artificial
  intelligence who commands the ship.
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus is a deeply narrative video game. You will have to solve
  some puzzles and explore in order to advance in the story. The universe and
  story will unveil branching along the scenary, objects and documents left behind
  by the people who lived in the Lazarus at some point.
  .
  In addition if you search and connect the dots maybe a greater puzzle will be
  revealed and the darker truth around you will become brighter.
  .
  GAMEPLAY
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus is a first person exploration game. There is a main story
  you'll play but you'll have to search and inspect every detail of the scenary
  looking for clues, notes, letters and objects and piece by piece gather
  information about what's happening around you.
  .
  There are a lot of mysteries aboard the USSC Lazarus and depends on you how many
  of them you can resolve along your journey. At the end of it maybe you resolve
  the bigger puzzle around what's going on. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're
  wrong. You'll need to have in mind every detail in order to unveil the whole
  story.
  .
  You'll have to resolve some puzzles as well, but we wanted to integrate them in
  the narrative and the scenery. You are in a spaceship and we wanted it to feel
  like it. The interaction with these puzzles is the same as in the rest of the
  game trying to not break the immersion in the story.
  .
  And you'll also can interact with the terminals and computers around the ship.
  Some will give you key information, others will help you in your way out. There
  is a whole operating system full of software and apps filled with information of
  any kind to explore and take advantage of. You'll have a tool (called
  Mnem/0z1n3) that will help you gathering and classifying information and
  breaking through password protected terminals.

  PROLOGUE DEMO
  .
  The Fall of Lazarus: The First Passenger is the conclusive prologue and demo of
  The Fall of Lazarus. In this little adventure set in the year 2180 you will play
  as Caleb Rogers, a Gen-Ethics (an audit firm focused on controlling the
  normative and quality of criogenic, clonation and genetic alteration processes)
  who wakes up in the USSC Lazarus against his will.The First Passenger is a
  little slice of the final game where we showcase all the playable mechanics of
  the full game and also works as an example of the narrative we want to play
  with. You can play a whole level of the USSC Lazarus out of the five levels will
  include the final game, every one of them highly detailed and full of objects
  and terminal to interact with while playing the main story. But we wanted you to
  enjoy this little stand alone experience separately if you want to. This is only
  the prologue with another protagonist but we highly recommend you to stay tuned
  and, when the day comes, enjoy the full experience.
  .
  REFERENCES
  .
  When we have to describe The Fall of Lazarus in a phrase we always say it's like
  Firewatch (Campo Santo) meets the film Moon (Duncan Jones).
  .
  The astonishing off-frame and foreshadowing narrative of Moon is our core
  narrative reference and the slow paced development of the plot and clever
  dialogues of Firewatch are really inspiring to us.
  .
  Of course we're filled with references such us Gone Home, Mind: Path to
  Thalamus, The Guest and films like 2001: a space odyssey or Alien. Even Lost
  series are being really influencing because of how it works the mysteries and
  characters.
  .
  PLATFORMS
  .
  We will launch The Fall of Lazarus on PC at first. We obviously want to release
  it on as much platforms as we can, but right now we have to focus on the PC
  version. We also like to port the game to VR but we have to wait to see how
  things work.

genre: Strategy
description:
  Feud is a turn-based strategy game made by some guys you haven't heard of yet.
  Originally a board game designed by Dave Cordell, it's been polished and tweaked
  and generally mucked about with to bring it to the glowing screen you're reading
  this description on. Unless you printed it out? Think of the trees. Please.
  .
  Condensed abstract strategy!
  .
  Imagine chess, but on a four-by-four grid, where pieces are swapped rather than
  moved, each piece has its own special ability and--
  .
  OK, not so much like chess. What you can expect is a highly condensed little
  abstract strategy game which is easy enough to learn but quite tricky to get
  good at. The AI still beats us sometimes. The computers are winning. Please get
  good at Feud so we can beat them.
  .
  Cross-platform!
  .
  Feud has full cross-platform play between PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. This
  means you can play Feud at your boring job, then on the bus on the way home from
  your boring job, then on your computer at home while you recover from your
  boring job.
  .
  Please note that we do not recommend playing Feud during your commute if you
  walk to work, especially if you live in a city with lots of open manhole covers
  which is pretty much what I imagine New York to be like. I dunno, I've never
  been.
  .
  You haven't told me much about this game yet, to be honest!
  .
  I'm not very good at this. Sorry. Anyway, look, the game's pay-whatever and only
  a couple of hundred megabytes. You might as well, really.

  A STORY ABOUT DIMENSIONS, SHAPES AND JEWELS
  .
  According to the Flat Kingdom's legends, the world was once filled with malice
  and chaos because the 3D realm dominated all. But one day, a wise sorcerer
  created six Magical Jewels that kept the effects of the third dimension at bay,
  granting peace and prosperity to the beautiful 2D world.
  .
  However, one day an evil masked thief named Hex stole one of those Jewels and
  kidnapped the princess. This disrupted the balance and made the chaos return.
  .
  The king of Flat Kingdom knew there was only one being able to save their land:
  Flat, the little shapeshifting hero! With his unique abilities, he's not only
  able to change his shape, but is also the only one in the kingdom capable of
  withstanding the 3D chaos.
  .
  Now the time has come. Flat must use his incredible powers to save the world and
  restore the Flat Kingdom to its former glory. Will he be able to stop Hex before
  it's too late?
  .
  GAMEPLAY
  .
  Flat Kingdom is filled with fun platforming action, puzzles and some
  Metroidvania elements. It also features a unique combat system! Instead of
  directly attacking your foes, you'll have to touch them while transformed in the
  correct shape to beat them! Kinda like a rock-paper-scissor game.
  .
  Every shape in Flat Kingdom beats the opposite, so sharp triangles can defeat
  the soft circles, heavy squares beat the fragile triangles and squishy circles
  can triumph over the slow squares. Both enemies and puzzles can be beaten using
  the correct shape and strategy, so you'll have to observe them and come up with
  the best solution.
  .
  You can also learn new abilities along the way that will help you solve even
  more puzzles, beat enemies faster and reach new areas that were inaccessible to
  you before!
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Jump into a beautiful papercraft world, filled with details and references to
  classic games.
  .
  Test your might with epic and challenging battles against giant bosses.
  .
  Uncover all of the game's secrets! There are side quests, upgrades and all kinds
  of surprises.
  .
  Learn all about the kingdom's lore and history by finding hidden scrolls.
  .
  Music by legendary composer Manami Matsumae! (Mega Man, Shovel Knight).

  Flux's game modes are treated as "jobs" each day. By participating in one, you
  shift the game forward in time. Each mode has a Flux value representing the
  game's music volume and speed rate that rise and fall depending on the mode's
  mechanics:
  .
  Groove: A traditional rhythm activity tasking players with pressing the correct
  inputs at
  .
  Freestyle: A fidget style game where you define your own rhythm, reflect and
  zone out to the beat.

  Rash+Slash: An action-oriented mode that pits you against incoming enemy robots.
  Use your trusty katana to cut your way through the enemy!
  .
  Assault: A beat-em-up mode that throws you into the heat of battle, challening
  players to survive a gauntlet of robots and enemy soldiers that are armed to the
  helmet with special attacks, a variety of weapons and keep on coming in waves.
  .
  Mecha: Like Freestyle, but in the open skies above the city. Reflect, find your
  groove and enjoy the view.
  .
  Armament: An action-oriented mode that has you defending the skies with your
  Mech airship. Take out the incoming robots with your blasters!
  .
  In order to add your own music you must have the following: an mp3 format music
  file, the file renamed to "track1", "track2", "track3", "track4" or "track5",
  and finally the file must be added to the game's included Music folder. Once the
  game is run it'll automatically load up these tracks sequentially as you begin
  to cruise. If you want to play another song, simply stop cruising and begin
  again to "skip" that track!
  .
  If you enjoy the music as much as I do,give Quantum Dylan a listen!

genre: Platformer
description:
  Fossil Echo is a short and challenging story driven platformer with hand drawn
  2D graphics. Set in a fantastical world, it tells a wordless tale of adventure
  and mystery.
  .
  Features
  .
  Varied and detailed environments
  .
  Hand animated 2D characters
  .
  Over 15 minutes of fully animated cutscenes
  .
  A wordless, mysterious story
  .
  Breathtaking orchestral score
  .
  Very dynamic and demanding platforming gameplay
  .
  Tense stealth mechanics
  .
  Easy Mode lets you enjoy the story without worrying too much about the
  challenge.
  .
  Well hidden secrets and unlockables
  .
  No HUD or on-screen indications
  .
  Speedrun-Friendly (in-game timers...)
  .
  Story
  .
  Influenced by the Oddworld series, Ico, and Shadow of the Collosus, as well as
  Studio Ghibli films, Fossil Echo tells the story of a young boy and his journey
  to climb a giant tower in the middle of the sea. How and why he got there are
  questions that will be answered via playable flashbacks during his ascent. The
  game offers over 15 minutes of fully animated cutscenes and the story is told
  without any dialogue or written text.
  .
  Gameplay
  .
  Fossil Echo mixes old-school, "die & retry" platforming gameplay with some
  stealth elements. As in Abe's Oddysee and Another World, you have little margin
  for error; precise movement and timing is required to get through and avoid
  confrontation, as the character is young, weak, and unable to fight or kill,
  most of the time...
  .
  Art
  .
  Fossil Echo features a detailed art style, with pre-rendered/hand painted
  backgrounds and hand animated 2D characters. Adopting the style of animated
  film, it presents an array diverse environments, from lush forest to snow
  covered tower. With no HUD or any indications displayed on screen, the game aims
  at immersing you from start to finish.
  .
  Sound
  .
  The world of Fossil Echo is brought to life by over two hours of unique,
  original music by John Robert Matz (Gunpoint, Rodina) and sound design by Gordon
  McGladdery (Rogue Legacy, Fantastic Contraption). Music and sound work in
  concert to set the mood and highlight the story and actions during gameplay and
  cutscenes.
  .
  Fossil Echo is developed by Phil Crifo (Story, Art & Design), Thierry Boura
  (Programming), John Robert Matz (Music), and A Shell In The Pit (Sound Design).

  The world has ended once before, and there are those who aim to end it again.
  The demon summoned to embark this second apocalypse is only a child, and a woman
  who has lost it all resolves to save her. A half-hour long narrative game with
  survival gameplay elements and two endings.
  .
  The year is 19XX. The world has been lost to a demon apocalypse, the remnants of
  this devastation staining the landscape and leaving mere dozens of people alive.
  The wastes are harsh, and camaraderie is hard to come by. You play as Del, a
  bruiser who patrols the wastes in her truck. She's hardened by this dead world,
  but something softer lies beneath her violent exterior.
  .
  Despite the destruction of it all, there are those in the end of the world who
  feel that perhaps the first time didn't quite take. On an average patrol, Del
  spots a pillar of fire in the distance and the source of it can only be one
  thing: demons have been summoned once more. But even demons can be innocent.
  Barrett is no more than a child, and those left in the world are either out to
  get her, or to control her.

  Four Horsemen is a visual novel / SLG about homelands and the immigrant
  experience. Play as a group of four contemporary immigrant teenagers squatting
  in a World War II era machine gun bunker, trying to find a place for themselves
  in a pre-apocalyptic, present-dystopian country that has no place for them. Will
  you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents
  fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents' identity at any cost, at the
  price of being a permanent stranger in your home country? Or will you strike out
  on your own, turning against both your homelands to shape a destiny for
  yourself? Love is all you need...and also improvised firearms.
  .
  Drawing from the developers' own lived experiences, interviews with current and
  former immigrant teens from around the world, and a year of painstaking
  anthropological research, featuring 4 different main storylines, 9 different
  endings, 12 different playable homelands (all of which play differently), and a
  multitude of agonizing, important decisions, Four Horsemen is the most
  heartwarmingly familiar, brutally honest video game about the immigrant
  experience ever created. One playthrough can be finished in a matter of hours,
  but you'll want to revisit it again and again to see all of the many stories the
  game has to tell...and to pursue that elusive dream of a land you can call your
  own.
  .
  Exciting Bullet Points!!
  .
  YOUR DECISIONS MATTER. Hard choices you make at the beginning come back to haunt
  you at the end. Characters turn out to be heroic or villainous depending on how
  you treat them--and they don't always reward you for treating them well.
  .
  NO TWO COUNTRIES PLAY ALIKE. Each homeland has its own unique vocabulary, set of
  cultural values, prejudices, and history. Choices that are a good idea in one
  country turn out to be a reaaaaally bad idea in another. Like a real immigrant,
  you'll have to read your new culture and learn to adapt.
  .
  NOT JUST BLACK AND WHITE. No faction reputation system! No alignment meter! Four
  Horsemen offers realistic, genuinely difficult moral choices, and to some
  questions there are no right answers--only different consequences.
  .
  DELIGHTFUL CRAFTING SYSTEM. Make that cold, austere war bunker feel like home--
  dive into dumpsters scrounging for parts, or buy them with your earnings from
  your terrible day job, and make reasonable DIY facsimiles of things you can't
  afford! Characters interact with things you build. Make a disco ball and they'll
  throw a dance party, patch up that hole in the roof and they'll enjoy a quiet
  moment together on a rainy day. But beware--the system is not exactly fair to
  immigrants...
  .
  TRIUMPH OVER HATE. A bigot pulls a knife on you--what do you do? Do you try to
  de-escalate the situation with words...or respond by drawing your own blade? Our
  combat system replicates the anxiety and tension of real violence, not a power
  fantasy.
  .

  About
  .
  On your way back home through the solar system, you will encounter countless
  lifeless obstacles which you must dodge. Using your small arsenal of galactic
  gardening tools, you can plant life onto these obstacles to calm them and grant
  you an easier path back home. Dodge everything, and Plant Trees!
  .
  Weapons
  .
  As your mission is to sprout as many trees throughout the galaxy as possible,
  your ship is equipped with the latest in galactic gardening technologies. You
  switch between:
  .
  (very) Berry Blaster
  .
  With this weapon you get the most seed output per second. As you upgrade the
  Berry Blaster, the more seeds you produce. At full upgrade you gain two gatling
  guns spraying seedlings at double the speed!
  .
  Copter' Cannon
  .
  The Copter' Cannon fires much slower than the Berry Blaster, but can plant on
  multiple targets and knocks affected targets away from the player. At full
  upgrade you gain to alternating cannons that fire the largest seed specimens in
  the galaxy at double speed!
  .
  Protect & Pollinate
  .
  With this weapon activated, your ship is surrounded with a protective aura that
  will pollinate any targets that get inside the field. It also slows the movement
  of all targets that enter the field, protecting the ship and giving you time to
  maneuver through the field of obstacles. Each upgrade to this weapon increases
  the pollination rate, and aura radius.

  about the choices you make.

  level, your purpose is to open and reach the door, which will lead you to a
  different level.

  As you discover the mechanics behind each element and symbol in the tiles, you
  are able to manipulate their position, in order to reach the door.
  .
  In each level, you'll be able to select the next-level's hexagram, so when you
  cross the door, that's the level you'll be playing next.
  .
  The final purpose is to visit and complete all 64 levels. More than just 64
  puzzles, the entire game is one big puzzle.

  You're a ghost. You're not sure why. You awaken in a world a with a whole lot of
  questions and not a whole lot of answers.
  .
  Make strange friends... Uncover secrets... Gather... eyedrops?
  .
  Something tells me we're gonna be just as confused when we're done here. Maybe
  even more so...
  .
  Ghost Story is a story driven action RPG currently being developed by me as a
  solo project! I'm still very much a beginner at game-making but doing this
  project has taught me  a lot and I'm excited to learn even more as I continue.
  It's still pretty early into development but I have completed this demo of the
  prologue chapter for people to enjoy. :^)
  .
  This demo is playable with keyboard or xinput devices, and is available on the
  following platforms:
  .
  Windows
  .
  macOS (COMING AT A LATER TIME CUZ IM BROKE IM SORRY ;n;)
  .
  Ubuntu
  .
  Caution: There are a few scenes that those who are photosensitive should be
  aware of: (bright flashing lights, rapidly changing colors). However, there is
  an in-game option to dampen these effects. The game will ask you early on if you
  are sensitive to such things. (I'd also recommend answering yes to this question
  if you are streaming the game or recording video for a lot of people to see.)
  .
  Note: Configurable controls are only available for keyboard users at this time.
  Gamepad configuration is planned, though.

  Up to 4 players can cheer along with squad leader Samantha in this fast-paced
  game of telegraph cheerleading. When she yells "Gimme a B!", respond by entering
  in the real Morse code for the letter B. Go Morse Go! Arcade Edition has four
  game modes that will put your Morse code skills to the test:
  .
  Championship mode: Race against human or CPU opponents to enter random letters
  the fastest. Fill up your hype meter first to win!
  .
  Tournament mode: GMG!AE features its own single-player campaign using
  Championship mode's rules - enter the big tournament and face off against the
  best cheerleaders in the world, all from the comfort of your home. (This mode is
  automatically selected if you play Championship mode with one player.)
  .
  Survival mode: Cheerleading is a demanding sport, even via telegraph. Enter an
  endless set of letters, but make too many mistakes, and you're out!
  .
  Pep Rally mode: New to Arcade Edition, in this co-op mode, your squad has a set
  number of rounds to fill a shared hype meter. Will you hype up the crowd, or
  make them fall asleep?
  .
  Each mode has customizable rules that allow you to adjust the length and
  difficulty of matches. Players can also customize their appearance by unlocking
  new looks - accessorize, change your uniform, or show your spirit as different
  characters such as the Fighting Scootsies' mascot, the airhorn-obsessed cheer
  pup DJ POM, or world-renowned telegraph prodigy Morse Playing Chicken.
  .
  Go Morse Go! Arcade Edition's four difficulty levels ensure fun for all,
  regardless of your prior Morse code experience. Beginners can enter at the J.V.
  level, in which Samantha tells you the exact dots-and-dashes translation, and
  learn Morse code along the way (like I did while making this game). Seasoned
  telegraph veterans can ramp the difficulty all the way up to Remorseless, a
  lightning-fast test of your Morse code knowledge - there are also calibration
  tools available to set the Morse timing to match their own personal speed and
  play the game at their own pace.

  .
  The tale begins in 1987, in the Olde Far Off Kingdom of Michigan. Local do-
  gooder Bill is standing obliviously in the street, smoking a self-rolled
  cigarette of what we'll assume is a legal substance. While consuming his
  cigarette's combusting contents, Bill is stung by a massive wasp. Like, no,
  seriously, a super big-ass wasp. Realizing his disdain for wasps, Bill sets out
  to eradicate the wasp scourge by attacking them with his mouth-based pellet
  shooting abilities.
  .
  Can Bill defeat the WASP KING and save the world from their horrible sting?
  .
  Find out by playing GOD, I HATE WASPS!
  .
  Three quick-fire floors in the Wasp Castle, complete with secret rooms.

description:
  Following in the footsteps of critically acclaimed Lydia, Good Mourning doesn't
  shy away from serious themes, but at the same time it's also a warm-hearted take
  on the little things that make everyday life worth living.
  .
  'The structure of Good Mourning is all about breaking the form. Traditional
  linear narrative is a poor fit for a digital game, for games revolve around
  choices and interactivity. And as software products games offer a possibility
  for randomly generated content. This is impossible for other mediums, such as
  literature and film. We see these factors as possibilities rather than
  restrictions, and we want to explore how deep this rabbit hole actually is.
  .
  Good Mourning combines visual novels into a collection of mini games.
  .
  Emphasis is on a story and players are encouraged to experience it through
  several playthroughs.
  .
  The story adapts to the choices players make, and portions of it are randomly
  selected to ensure replay value.
  .
  Replayability is also a key element in the story, as well as the ability to
  choose and how other people perceive you. Choosing differently has an impact on
  the story and how it is interpreted.
  .
  The interpretation of the story is where the emergent narrative comes to play:
  the player sees only segments of the storyline, and the bigger picture has to be
  formed through imagination.
  .
  Warning: The story depicts scenes of abuse, intoxication & strong language.

  Info
  .
  Graveyard Shift is a #spooky FPS with unique game mechanics and a mise-en-scne
  that mixes both toonish and horror elements together! Yes, we did it.
  .
  You are fighting against restless ghosts and liches. They revolt, because too
  many graves are dug in the graveyard, whose keeper is you. Your purpose is to
  re-kill the undead! Your only friends are mushrooms, those you use to make
  mushroom bombs.
  .
  Gameplay
  .
  Your ammo is elemental mushrooms, there are 5 different elements of mushrooms
  those you collect from the ground. You create bombs with those elemental
  mushrooms (2 Fire, 1 Water, for example) using number keys 1 to 5. Your enemies
  also have elements; enemy's element and the elements of your mushroom-bomb
  determine the damage you deal. For example, you deal more damage to a Fire ghost
  if you prepare a bomb with Water mushrooms.
  .
  There are 2 types of enemies: Normal ghosts and liches. Normal ghosts are melee
  attackers, they use claws. Whereas, liches throw you stones and they are much
  stronger than normal ghosts.
  .
  Game modes
  .
  We have 2 game modes: Waved and Survival. You fight against 10 waves of enemies
  in the first. Survival lasts as long as you are alive.
  .
  Power-ups
  .
  There are 4 power-ups: Shield, Slow Time, Magnet, Infinite Mushrooms.

  Story: ~ 1849, Great Britain
  .
  After a malevolent cult enjoyed a continueing growth of popularity, it became a
  threat to all people who did not share their philosophy. In 1845, the cult had
  taken control by force over several city districts or even whole villages
  throughout Great Britain. Now, a priest is declared to sneak into one of those
  reprobated cities to finish a task, that multiple people had failed
  accomplishing before. Thats were our story begins...
  .
  What is Grime & Gaslight about?
  .
  Your task is to bless twelve crosses with holy water (for story and random
  mode).  Therefore you have got three phials, each containing one charge for a
  blessing. You have to carefully look around in the city for these crosses and
  stoups, since you need to refill your phials.
  .
  This game challenges your memory and orientation. Where have you been before?
  Where do you saw the last cross, you were not able to bless, since you hear
  something right behind you and had to keep going? Decide wise, when its time to
  spend holy water on a cross, for its your only defense against the unholy
  creature that crawls through the streets.

  games that you receive are:
  .
  SHOTGUN -  A sidescroller shooting game where you play as a mother ready to dish
  out bloody revenge on the low life scum who kidnapped her son.  Fast paced
  violence and over the top characters abound throughout this game.  This version
  of Shotgun adds new rooms and new enemies, making it even more difficult than
  before!

  WITCHING HOUR AT HELL HOUSE - A hellish escape the room puzzle/horror game!
  Escape the Hell House before the "Tall Man" arrives and maybe even find the root
  to all this insanity within the basement.  This version adds a new, never before
  seen puzzle and ghost to escape!
  .
  PEEPAW - Oh no!  Peepaw was messing around with the Ouija board and got
  possessed again!  Help find Meemaw and escape!  That's right, your good ol'
  grandpa has been possessed by demonic forces and is now attempting to murder you
  and your family!  Traverse a dark house, find your cousins for upgrades, and
  rescue Meemaw before you're all dragged to Hell!  This version features new
  Peepaw behaviors.
  .
  Action, horror, thrills, and chills are at your fingertips in this sleazy
  collection of retro madness!
  .
  There are free versions to all of these games right here on itch.io, so this
  "director's cut" package is a way to help me continue making games inspired by
  trash cinema!  They also of course come with some new bells and whistles if
  you're already a fan.

genre: Compilation;Demos
description:
  In the before-time - your childhood, or perhaps those of your forebears - THE
  MALL stood king among shopping locales. People of all kinds flocked to them,
  swarming store after store, purchasing copious amounts of tie-dyed fabric and
  greasy food and novelty knives. But now the people are ,DEAD, and the corporate
  catacombs stand silent. Their only customers now are rats and cockroaches.
  .
  Of late, though, there have been murmurs in the emptiness - flashes of too-
  bright colors, flickers of wires and flesh, strangled electric sounds, almost
  like SCREAMS. Brave or foolish souls have returned to the sites of their pasts,
  spurred by curiosity. The few who have returned, amidst their gibbering, mad
  cries, spoke of change. Storefronts peddling wares that they do not contain,
  advertisements that flicker in the corner of one's eye, and distant, echoing
  footsteps, coming from everywhere and NOWHERE in the dust-suffused halls.
  .
  Your town bore one such DECREPIT MALL, a hopeful tourist destination long since
  abandoned by the few teens that frequented it. Yet you find yourself standing
  before it in the gloom, for the first time in years. Lights flicker from within,
  tinny music emanates from disconnected speakers. And a phrase BURNS in your mind
  as if carved with a burning knife...

  Roused by the crackle of static, a lingering sense of dread crawls across the
  floor. You sit alone in your room. A dimly lit memory repeats in your head. 17
  demos too horrible to describe keep you from your bed. Each one is a personally
  crafted nightmare. You've tried to tell others, no one understands. A CRT you
  don't remember owning flashes to life. Frozen in place you look upon the
  flickering screen to spy a dismal, bloodied scene. A cracked and faded jewel
  case sits close beside. A pale grey plastic box sits in front, emitting a low
  whirring noise. Will you take to the controller or let yourself be taken over?

  The "Demo Disc" is not a physical disc (as amazing as that would be) as we don't
  have the time or resources to organise the can of worms that is monetization and
  physical production. We would need some sort of publisher to handle the money
  split and production if we were to sell a physical copy. There's also been some
  confusion over this, these games are all built on modern engines to evoke the
  feeling and aesthetic of late 90s games, the disk would not be able to run on
  any sort of hardware from the time. The demo disc is a free downloadable exe for
  Windows only. Supporting other operating systems would likely double or triple
  the work it took to organise the disc.

  The horrific times you had with the DEMO DISC 2020 are nothing more than a
  painful memory. It's been a year - life has gone on. You've survived. It's over.
  .
  Or so you thought.
  .
  Yet now you awake to find yourself in a room swathed in shadow, the memories of
  your arrival much too painful to confront in your uncertain state. The room is
  empty - save for one thing. A stone pedestal, nakedly imposing. Something wants
  you to approach.
  .
  And you do.
  .
  On the pedestal lies a lone, cracked jewel case. Your fingers run across the
  surface...
  .
  DEMO DISC
  .
  Without warning the darkness dies, sickly light flooding the room, and you find
  yourself in a massive building of stone walls and marble pillars. The air is
  cold yet stuffy, as if you breathe gaseous dust. A showcase - you stand within a
  showcase, a showcase of curious remnants of the culture outside this place, of
  the culture you'll never return to, and the shapes within the displays sting
  your eyes like glass needles...

  Looking for shelter from the harsh Winter weather, you approach the abandoned
  cabin out in the woods. As you reach for the doorknob, a gust of icy wind throws
  the door open, pushing you in. The fireplace lights ablaze and you close the
  door behind you. In the center of the room, you see it...that festive amalgam of
  24 doors: The Madvent Calendar. Each door will lead you to a different strange
  world of horror and delight, but may only be opened if that day has arrived!

  A Haunting New Tradition...
  .
  Amidst a sea of dark isolation you've come to call home, her voice beckons. The
  void melts away, and you drown in moonlight.
  .
  Your eyes adjust, and you find yourself drifting closer towards a small village
  nestled in the mountains. Houses dot their way up to a peak, a queer religious
  symbol its climax.
  .
  There she prays.
  .
  24 Dreams, 24 Days.
  .
  Another year passes, and Madvent returns with another 24 games to keep you up
  until Christmas.
  .
  It's 2Madvent 2Calendar!

  .
  A stack of news article sits on your desk, two stampers on each side - green to
  approve, red to reject. Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as
  corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will
  you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried
  about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink,
  even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support
  current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?
  .
  After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you
  publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or
  perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and
  drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events
  about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers,
  or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech?
  .
  On the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and
  immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your
  brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and
  social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little
  girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day
  provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs.
  .
  But every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen
  to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you
  watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your
  doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your
  doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of
  cash?
  .
  After good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a
  growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.

  Cortex is in ruins.
  .
  After waking from a five week coma, Theo Kavinsky finds his life in disrepair,
  and with no memory of the accident, it's up to Ted and Teddy - the conscious and
  subconscious voices in his head - to work out what happened, and put his life
  back on track.
  .
  Headspun is an FMV/Adventure hybrid which puts you in the shoes of Ted: the
  Director of Cortex - the rational, intelligent voice in Theo's head. What Ted
  thinks is best for Theo isn't necessarily a view shared by Teddy, however; the
  primal, emotional subconscious voice...
  .
  In the process of repairing Cortex, re-hiring a team and finding out what
  happened the night of the accident, Ted and Teddy must cast aside their
  differences and learn to work together. Headspun is a game about recovery,
  discovery, and the ongoing battle between logic and emotion.

developer: Alec Robbins
publisher: Alec Robbins
genre: Visual Novel
description:
  Imagine you're the most popular kid in school. So popular, in fact, that you're
  dating every single person in your class. The only problem? You've decided to
  break up with all of them, one by one.
  .
  Heartbreak High is an arcade-style spin on visual novels and dating simulators
  that asks you to break up with all of your high school sweethearts instead of
  woo them. A single play-through can be completed in one 20-40 minute sitting,
  with each break-up featuring a unique branching story path and lovable (or
  unlovable?) characters for you to crush beneath your feet over and over again.
  .
  If you couldn't already guess, it won't be easy. There's only 40 minutes until
  the end of the school day, and on top of that you must be careful not to act too
  cruel, too sexy, too selfish, and more... sometimes you'll have to stay tactful
  and sympathetic, while other break-ups will call for a somewhat firmer approach.
  It's as stressful as the real thing, baby!!!! And that's not even mentioning the
  various surprises and obstacles that'll get in your way!!!!
  .
  features:
  .
  over 15 unique choose-your-own-adventure-style break-up encounters (any less
  than that wouldn't have been stressful enough)
  .
  multiple playthroughs encouraged - try saying something different next time
  because there's some wild stuff in there
  .
  nearly everything on screen is hand-drawn (including the typeface and menus
  even!) which i think is very impressive don't you??
  .
  an extensive original soundtrack by Ronnie Dezsi that brings every character
  (and menu screen) to life
  .
  very funny writing (i know that's subjective but it's also definitely true in
  this case, sorry)
  .
  there's a bunch of mini-games!!! they're like little tiny games inside of the
  bigger game, if you can believe it
  .
  lots of fun characters that are cute and might make you sad to break up with
  .
  it's a cheap quick game that doesn't take very long to play!!! it respects your
  time!!! isn't that nice!!!
  .
  i made this game almost entirely by myself! my name's Alec Robbins! hello!
  .
  there's a FREE PLAY mode where you can't lose but you also can't get to the
  final level. it's also good for role-playing without penalty!
  .
  you can get chocolate in the game but you can't use it for anything. i should
  have taken that out of the game actually
  .
  a surprise ending... not allowed to say more... my apologies for even bringing
  it up in the first place...
  .
  maybe you can even choose NOT to break up with them??? would that give you a
  different ending??? maybe??? hmm???

genre: Shooter
description:
  Armed with a simple yet stylish revolver and six devastatingly plump bullets,
  you must reset the security mainframe to restore order and reap the rewards of a
  job well done. To succeed in the game, players will need to move carefully and
  make smart use of their bullets, items, and the environment as rushing into new
  areas is the fastest way to get killed in the untamed wild of the neon
  corridors.
  .
  Limited Ammunition
  .
  Begin each attempt to reach the mainframe with just six bullets for your
  revolver that must be picked back up after each shot and manually reloaded one
  by one - make them count.
  .
  A Plethora of Items
  .
  Discover items and perks to aid you on your way to the mainframe. From homing
  bombs and coin magnets to a teleporter and high heels, each item will change up
  your approach. Choose wisely as you can only carry one item unless, of course,
  you find a backpack.
  .
  Shopping and Banking
  .
  While death is permanent, money in the bank can live on for future attempts at
  reaching the mainframe. Make a deposit or withdrawal from one of many
  conveniently placed automatic banking machine throughout the facility. Or just
  blow your cash on a shopping spree - up to you.
  .
  Life Decisions
  .
  Invest in items like Life Insurance or a Last Will that, if carried during the
  time of your unexpected death, will save your money, bullets, bombs, and
  keycards for your next attempt.
  .
  Aggressive Creatures + Malfunctioning Security
  .
  Face down dozens of nasty creatures lurking around the colorful hallways and the
  now malfunctioning security drones meant to defend against those same creatures.

genre: Simulation
description:
  Build your fleet, trade, explore and conquer
  .
  Helium Rain is a single-player space simulation that places you at the helm of a
  spacefaring company. Trade resources, buy ships and stations to fulfill
  contracts ! Dock at stations to buy and sell you wares or upgrade your ship,
  upgrade your technology to be more efficient and militarize your fleet to
  prevent piracy.
  .
  You will need to master both real-time action and long-term strategy: destroying
  a freighter has a direct impact on the economy, while declaring war will make
  your spaceflight environment slightly more hostile...
  .
  13 playable ships with weapon and engine upgrades
  .
  Build and fly fleets of fighters, bombers, cargos, corvettes or capital ships.
  Buy new engines and weapons.
  .
  Fast-paced combat with Newtonian flight, localized damage and joystick support
  .
  There is no speed limit in Helium Rain. You can fly at half a mile a second
  while aiming backwards. Aim for critical systems in order to disable ships, kill
  their crew or capture targets, and don't fly into asteroids.
  .
  Complex economy model
  .
  Take advantage of a complex simulation of space trade to be the most competitive
  company.
  .
  A planetary system to explore
  .
  Explore around 25 sectors orbiting the gas giant Nema and its moons.
  .
  Procedural contracts, world exploration, technology upgrades
  .
  Pick contracts and build your empire to become the largest company.
  .
  Quick-action skirmish mode
  .
  Setup your fleet, pick an opponent and go into fighting action right away !
  .
  A world that feels real
  .
  Your ships have generators, radiators, weapons, engines, cargo bays or life
  support systems - they all work together. Every thruster on your ship plays a
  role. Aim for engines to pin down your enemies, or send them spinning around by
  destroying power stations. Most ships have more than thirty individual parts !
  You can customize the most important parts of your ships - your main engines,
  attitude control thrusters, weapons and hull colors.
  .
  Your competitors are independent factions, companies with the same goal as yours
  - ruling the system. They will try to undercut you, or even attack you if you
  become a threat to them. But don't be too quick to destroy them, as war can
  break the supply of resources you depend on ! Attacking freighters will destroy
  resources, with the potential to cause an economic crisis.
  .
  Recommended system
  .
  64-bits Windows or Linux system (32-bits systems are not supported)
  .
  Intel Core i5 or equivalent
  .
  GTX 970 or equivalent
  .
  4GB of RAM
  .
  5GB of free disk space
  .
  Linux-specific support
  .
  Linux is fully supported, with the following caveats.
  .
  AMD users should launch the game with the "-vulkan" command-line parameter (full
  command "HeliumRain.sh -vulkan"), using the open-source radeonsi driver.
  .
  NVidia users can encounter a NVidia driver regression causing the game to render
  entirely white. Until this is fixed by NVidia, affected users should prefix the
  launch command with "__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0" (full command
  "__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0 ./HeliumRain.sh"). We anticipate this issue to be
  resolved soon.

  before each battle. Skills never grow obsolete, but instead provide new tactical

  exploring different facets of the world. Will you seek guidance from the Oracle
  or form an alliance with a shadowy network of spies? Stow away on a pirate

  From the creator of Pony Island...
  .
  In a creaky old tavern, in a forgotten corner of the video game universe, a
  storm is raging. The barkeep gets a patchy phone call. It's hard to tell what
  the caller is saying, but this much is clear: someone in The Six Pint Inn is
  planning a murder.
  .
  There are six patrons; all of them are video game protagonists trying to escape
  their past... But The Six Pint Inn has a way of bringing back old memories. Each
  flashback plays out in an entirely different genre, sometimes blending multiple.
  By exploring these memories you may discover the identity of the murderer... or
  you may learn much darker secrets.
  .
  In The Hex you will...
  .
  Control the six patrons and explore The Six Pint Inn
  .
  Delve into the memories of these cast-aside game protagonists to learn the truth
  of their past
  .
  Learn the identity of the would-be murderer... as well as the victim
  .
  The Hex takes roughly 6 hours to complete on the first playthrough.

genre: Puzzle
description:
  A simple yet challenging logic puzzle game currently in beta but nearing
  release! There are 92 hand made puzzles spread out across 4 difficulties along
  with an option to procedurally generate puzzles. All puzzles are guaranteed to
  require no guessing to solve. The puzzles can be generated with between 2-5
  colors, 5 different difficulty levels, and 7 different sizes. The puzzles are
  intended to be relaxing, so there is no time limit and no penalties for
  mistakes.
  .
  Played on a hex grid, you must complete two goals to solve the puzzles. The
  first goal is to find a path along the grid that connects two endpoints.
  However, as you make the path, the hex colors will cycle. The second goal is to
  get all hexes to the goal color. So you must find the path that results in all
  hexes reaching the goal color.
  .
  Color is a important part of the puzzle, but don't worry! There is a color blind
  mode you can enable in the settings which will add a unique pattern on hexes for
  each color if you need it.
  .
  About the beta
  .
  The core of the game, the puzzle generation and mechanics, are finished aside
  from any tweaking that may happen before full release. Most of what's left is
  finalizing the art style, working on the sound design, adding music, and general
  polish.
  .
  Buying the beta will get you access to all beta versions, and the full game once
  it releases, including a steam key once the game is on Steam. The beta is also
  at a discounted price! The full version will be more than $6.99.

  HIGHWAY BLOSSOMS REMASTERED
  .
  The update some of you asked for
  .
  Highway Blossoms: Remastered is the new definitive romance treasure hunt road
  trip experience. Most importantly, it's now fully voiced in English by a
  talented cast of actors. We've also remastered the soundtrack for a better
  listening experience, touched up the art for a better viewing experience, and
  added a Chinese translation for a better Chinese reading experience.
  .
  Highway Blossoms is a short yuri (lesbian) story set in the American Southwest.
  After an old gold rush miner's journal is discovered, supposedly detailing where
  he hid parts of his stash, a nationwide craze begins as would-be prospectors try
  to solve its clues and strike it rich.
  .
  Amber couldn't care less. Wandering the desert in a recently-inherited
  motorhome, she mourns the loss of her grandfather - indifferent and unaware of
  the hunt happening around her. It's not until she meets Marina, a young
  hitchhiker lost in New Mexico that the girls get swept up in the rush.
  .
  At least tens of words, maybe even hundreds. Although the last word count puts
  it around 90,000, so expect 6 or so hours of reading.
  .
  Grand, hand-painted vistas of actual landmarks in the western United States, all
  in glorious 1080p detail.
  .
  A huge soundtrack featuring the works of Smoke Thief, Jake Abernathie, Able
  Kirby, and other friends. Sounds right at home on your in-dash cassette tape
  player.
  .
  Accessibility options for days, including the ability to skip through everything
  in less than five minutes. But who would wanna do that?
  .
  Very serious additional game modes
  .
  Highway Blossoms: Next Exit - DLC Released!
  .
  Return to Las Vegas with Amber and Marina in this new Highway Blossoms story! A

  About the Game:
  .
  Home is a unique horror adventure set in a beautifully-realized pixel world.
  It's a murder mystery with a twist-because you decide what ultimately happens.
  .
  Awakened by an oncoming storm, you open your eyes to discover yourself in a
  strange, dark room-tucked away in a house that's not yours.
  .
  As you play the game, it changes-subtly, almost imperceptibly-to reflect your
  perspective. It's a horror game unlike any other, and as you'll discover, its
  truths are entirely subjective.

  The game doesn't have a tutorial (I'm sorry) so to play, use A and D on the
  keyboard or the left stick to move, and the mouse or the right stick to look
  around. P or the top button on the controller will pause, where you can adjust
  settings like volume and subtitles. The buildings in blue are significant points
  that will provide different bits of narrative if you fly over them. There are
  two endings.

  A game about the struggle to have a conversation while also stuffing your face
  with food.
  .
  You are at an all-you-can-eat hot pot restaurant. You're hungry, and you just
  want to do nothing but chow down.
  .
  But you're here with a friend, and you don't want it to seem like you're only
  here to eat!
  .
  Can you manage to keep up a conversation while cooking and filling your belly?
  .
  Features
  .
  Cook delicious meat, veggies, and tofu in a tasty broth until they're just
  right!
  .
  Multitask your way through three meals! You'll be cooking and eating while
  keeping up a conversation with your friend. Make sure she never figures out
  you're really just here for the food...
  .
  You get to direct the convo, but make sure you're ready to keep up with your
  friend's comments - she'll ask you what you thought about what she said later,
  and if you don't get it right, things could get ~*awkward*~

  A note for Mac users:  If you're running the game on Catalina it may take a few
  extra steps to get it running. See the comments section below for
  troubleshooting if you run into issues. Be sure to try using the Itch app to run
  the game (thanks Jennythewatt for pointing this out!).

  As Seen On!

  Rock Paper Shotgun: "...playing it has made me very hungry, so I'm off to go
  raid my fridge first."
  .
  PC Gamer:  "... the arse-tightening tension of Hot Hot Panic, a game about
  trying to hold a conversation while stuffing your face with meat and potatoes."
  .
  Waypoint: "This game scratches two very important itches for me: time management
  mechanics, and the aesthetics of delicious animated food. Also, it's a great
  excuse out of any friend dates you may have coming up...just saying."
  .
  The Verge:  "...it manages to take the fairly universal social situation of
  trying to talk and eat at the same time, and turn it into a clever and fun
  game."

  Too Much: Full textures and 8x anti-aliasing. Vsync! This is overkill and
  Fantastic looks better. But if you really want to, it's there.

  Memlog Hunter.10/thmw1: 'Lost in space. Surrounded. Strange structures that
  build themselves - hive-like. And at their core, alien starcells... Must get
  home. Back to Hunter's Moon. Must... survive! Am attacking now - full thrust -
  cannons locked in - FIRE!' Little do you know what you face: over 180 levels of
  galactic mayhem. Hope you are a CLEVER psychoblaster - or else...'
  .
  Originally released in 1987, Hunter's Moon is a strategic shoot 'em up set in
  deep space. Beautifully presented and thoughtfully designed, the game became an
  instant classic thanks to its measured balance of strategic planning and
  psychotic blasting. Boasting one of the earliest uses of procedurally-generated
  content in a computer game, Hunter's Moon pushed the boundaries of the genre and
  helped redefine what a shoot 'em up could be.
  .
  Hunter's Moon Remastered is a fully remastered, overhauled, and updated version
  of the seminal C64 shoot 'em up. The game has been remastered for C64 cartridge
  and boasts a host of amazing new features including over 50 new levels, 5 new
  star systems, new level types, new music, new playing modes, stunning intro and
  outro sequences, built-in level editor, and enhanced presentation including
  foreign language support.
  .
  After flying your trusty ship Hunter too close to a black hole, you find
  yourself lost in space on the wrong side of the galaxy, surrounded by sprawling,
  hive-like cities. At the core of each city lie mysterious alien Starcells -
  these contain valuable navigational data and must be collected to plot a course
  back home.
  .
  The aim of each level is to blast through the hive and grab the Starcells, a
  task made more challenging by the invincible Worker cells which patrol the
  cities repairing any damage inflicted. These Workers also bring the hive's
  defenses to life, causing them to spew deadly spores that can only be resisted
  by using your ship's trusty Perma-Shields.
  .
  The game features over 180 levels spread across 21 star systems. When all the
  Starcells on a level have been collected you'll enter the Bonus Game where you
  can earn a Perma-Shield and an extra life. You must complete every level within
  each star system to advance to the next; however, should you manage to collect
  four flashing Starcells you'll automatically jump to the next system.
  .
  As you progress through the different star systems you'll encounter an array of
  diverse and challenging hive types, including Attackers that throw out deadly
  spores, Darkcells which are only visible on radar, Switchers that change
  direction without warning, Jumpgates which jump to random locations, and
  Blackouts which plunge the hives into darkness.
  .
  Do you have the dexterity, precision timing and psychopathic blasting skills to
  find your way home to Hunter's Moon...?
  .
  Over 180 levels spread across 21 Star Systems
  .
  New level types including Jumpgates and Blackouts
  .
  Trainer Version designed for novice players

  The downloadable C64 digital version is designed for use with a C64 emulator -
  it cannot be used with an EasyFlash cartridge, 1541 Ultimate, or Turbo
  Chameleon. We recommend playing the game using VICE 3.1+, a popular emulator
  compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  .
  Therefore, there are two downloadable versions, one containing the game files,
  the other containing the game files plus a version of the VICE emulator. Both
  versions include a simple .BAT file to make running the game much simpler.
  Please be sure to consult the README file for more information.
  .
  Bonus: The downloads section now includes a special version of the game created
  especially for the C64 Mini, along with a "CJM" configuration file. Note that
  game saving is disabled in the C64 Mini version, both during the game and within
  the level editor - it is therefore necessary to use the C64 Mini's built-in save
  functionality to save your game and your level designs. Again, please consult
  the README file for more information.
  .
  The cartridge version of Hunter's Moon Remastered includes a cartridge, game
  manual, cover art postcard, and Thalamus sticker.  Status: Out of Stock!

  It's the sort of thing you don't stop playing until long after your day's

  The game contains all original 111 levels and attempts to have all the features
  of the original game, and even make it more engaging and fun to play by making
  it play more smoothly then the original. And by adding a level editor that
  allows you to share levels with your friends!
  .
  Extra features
  .
  Aside from the upgraded visuals, this version has some extra features compared
  to the original game.
  .
  Level editor that allows you to create levels and share with friends
  .
  You can now save and load your progress during a level, so you don't have to
  start over from scratch. Even if you have exited the game you can continue where
  you left off.
  .
  You can slow down time, to make specific tricks easier to pull off.
  .
  What is the game about?
  .
  For those who don't know what this game is based on, Supaplex used to be a
  popular Dos game that was developed in 1991 by mainly Philip Jespersen and
  Michael Stopp. It was a difficult but rewarding game. Many levels require you to
  think thoroughly before making any move.
  .
  The main character is called Murphy. His goal is to reach the exit of each
  level, in order to do this he must collect enough infotrons (atom like objects).
  However, in order to collect these objects you have to puzzle your way though
  levels where you have to think before you act. Making it a difficult but
  rewarding experience.

  FAQ
  .
  What do I do in Hyperspace Dogfights?
  .
  Mainly you fly a jet in a 2d environment and blow things up. You'll also
  complete randomized goals in order to finish individual waves. In-between waves
  you'll buy items that modify your jet in various ways. Zones end with random
  boss encounters. Difficulty is pretty harsh, you'll probably die a lot in the
  beginning. But each subsequent run will play out a little different. Throughout
  the game you'll unlock additional items to find on later runs. The game is
  fairly light on story, but you can piece together a narrative from item
  descriptions and combat chatter if you choose so.
  .
  Feature list?
  .
  - Juicy, impact-full and tense 2d air combat, framed in a weird sci-fi universe
  .
  - 5+ player jets to fly, all coming with 2 alternate starting loadouts to unlock
  .
  -200+ different passive items, some providing simple bonuses, some completely
  changing how your jet behaves
  .
  - 90+ sci-fi jet weapons, including beam weapons, explosives and aerial melee
  options
  .
  - 50 active items used for offense, defense or utility
  .
  - Strong focus on synergies and weird jet builds. Most items will interact with
  others, be it in positive and negative ways. All passives can stack with
  themselves.
  .
  - 7 zones with distinct enemy composition to explore
  .
  - 10 bosses to die against
  .
  - Various wave goals: Hunt ace pilots, raid ground targets, perform recon scans
  and more
  .
  - 12 late game challenge modes that can be freely combined with another
  .
  - Colorful pixel art, powered by the Pico8 16 palette
  .
  - An adaptive soundtrack with combat and menu tracks, consisting of 14 tunes by
  ENUIT and Ole Toensen
  .
  - Persistent unlocks with lots of items in the loot pool from the get go, but
  some things only unlockable through the endgame
  .
  - Finished runs can seamlessly transition into endless mode if you choose so
  .
  What platform does Hyperspace Dogfights run on?
  .
  Window PC and Linux (currently only tested on Ubuntu).
  .
  What are the system requirements?
  .
  CPU: 3.2 GHz
  .
  Graphics: GeForce GT 710 or better
  .
  Ram: 8 GiB
  .
  OS: Ubuntu 14.04 64bit or higher
  .
  Recent Windows
  .
  Only on Itch?
  .
  If you buy the game on itch you'll also get a steam key. If you bought it
  through a bundle this might not apply though.
  .
  Can I stream/make videos about Hyperspace Dogfights
  .
  (and monetize that)?
  .
  You absolutely can and I love you for it.
  .
  I found a bug? 0/10 worst game ever

  i hurt myself -+- postjam edition

  is a short Bitsy game based on the original jam version from 2018. I decided to
  update it to be something I could be more proud of, since it's my most viewed

  This version is greatly expanded, and is almost entirely a new game, so "postjam

  .
  A not-so-generic otome game with BL possibilities.
  .
  Instead of playing the heroine and choosing between several men that have
  typical dating-sim personalities, you play as the childhood friend. That's
  right! The route that's usually the easiest to complete is no longer available.
  You (Geum Park) are thrust into the world of a reverse harem, where your
  precious childhood friend (Emily Carter) is being hit on by two of your
  classmates (Ao Yazawa and Hong Yang Chan). You can choose to either play the
  role of a love interest and try to win the heroine's heart, or... you can play
  your own game and try to make the two boys fall for you instead! The choice is
  yours!
  .
  Note: The game takes place in Australia, so there are times when the characters
  may say things that seem a little odd to people not familiar with Aussie
  culture.
  .
  Additional Note: Australia is a multicultural place, a good majority of the
  population speak more than one language. As such, in certain routes the
  characters may end up speaking to one another in different languages.

genre: Interactive Fiction
description:
  If you're into if not us, you'll probably like my upcoming visual novel
  Amarantus! It's about loyalty and loss and screwing things up. It's less of a
  downer...mostly.
  .
  Seven years ago, five heroes were brought together to save the world. Their
  success came at the cost of their leader's life; the secret behind it cost them
  their friendship.
  .
  Now they've been summoned for a new heroic quest.
  .
  if not us is about the moment when they realise everything isn't going to be
  okay.
  .
  The demo above includes two of the five vignettes.
  .
  Included on the Nebula Awards Suggested Reading List 2018
  .
  if not us [is] sort of like if you made Watchmen a D&D party of fantasy world
  saviours instead of superheroes...one of the best text-based games I found in
  the Itch.io Racial Justice Bundle - First Five
  .
  if not us is splendid; wonderful...it's five eulogies and five broken hearts,
  and again, and again. I cannot recommend it enough. - Damon Reece, lead writer
  of Necrobarista
  .
  if not us is a must-play for anyone who tells people's stories. It's sort of
  about what happens after destiny is done with you, and it plays with format
  phenomenally, and I love it. - Nissa Campbell
  .
  A collection of heartbreaking vignettes...obscure at times, but deliberately and
  productively so. - Cat Manning
  .
  Five short stories from five alternate timelines, each from the perspective of a
  different character and with new insight into the overarching narrative.
  .
  Each story has its own style of interaction: watch your life flash before your
  eyes, write a letter to your loved ones, plead your case, or just stand still
  and think for a while.
  .
  Some of our heroes may yet turn away from their deadly fates, some may succumb,
  and some may need convincing.
  .
  Nearly 30,000 words of branching narratives.
  .
  The stories in the anthology can be played in (nearly) any order, but you might
  find yourself revisiting one or two later with new insight.
  .
  I hope you like dramatic irony.
  .
  And big women with horns.

  "In My Friend Carrie's Car" is an autobiographical text-based game. While
  driving one town over to buy some plants with a friend, you find yourself
  thinking back on some things that have happened over the last few years.
  .
  Content warnings: eating disorders (including some representations of unhealthy
  and damaging eating disorder thought processes), obsessive-compulsive disorder,
  intrusive thoughts, depression, reference to sex via discussion of birth
  control, self-harm mention. I want to really stress here that the
  representations of damaging eating disorder thought processes could especially
  be triggering to folks. I pretty directly wrote out versions of some of the
  thoughts I had during these periods of my life, many of which are from well
  before I was in recovery from my eating disorder.
  .
  This game discusses some of my experiences being mentally ill. Everybody
  experiences mental illness differently. This game is meant to be representative
  of some parts of my experiences, and no one else's. I am not claiming or
  attempting to represent a universal experience of mental illness (because there
  isn't one), but, rather, just one manifestation - my manifestation. Maybe our
  experiences look totally different, and that's fine. Both our experiences are
  valid, even if they look nothing alike. This game is also not an attempt to
  represent the whole of my experiences. It's just showing little parts.
  .
  Press the highlighted keys to choose your routes. You can press ESC or Q to quit
  at any time. Please play the game at an aspect ratio of 16x9. The game is best
  played with sound. I prefer it with headphones in. It's up to you, though.
  .
  Here are some resources and little things that have helped me. Maybe they'll
  help you, too.

  OCD Center of Los Angeles has a website with some descriptions of manifestations
  of OCD that I've found really helpful on a few occasions

  love

  This game was part of an undergrad thesis project that looked at the
  autobiographical representation of experiences of mental illness in games as a
  potentially therapeutic practice. This game was influenced by therapeutic
  exercises in journaling and narrative formation to aid in the processing of
  traumatic memory. The other game made for this project is Escort Yourself Out.

  THIS IS IN VERY EARLY TESTING
  .
  due to technical difficulties further development is on hold until the Godot
  Engine 4 release
  .
  Sorry for having not updated in over years now, but my old codebase on the old
  engine version just was very exhausting to maintain, and given it's not
  something i can work on 9-to-5 i decided to just wait with the rewrite. This
  project is not canceled, just on hiatus for now.
  .
  Current state:
  .
  the demo is exactly the same as the full version (so don't buy it yet unless you
  want to give me free money).
  .
  there's only a few levels
  .
  the story isn't fleshed out yet
  .
  but i've already hidden an easter egg somewhere in the code, let's see if
  someone finds it
  .
  consider this a proof of concept / prototype release, more content will be
  added.
  .
  We have a Discord you can leave any feedback on, would be greatly appreciated.
  .
  Alternatively any issues can be reported on our Gitlab or via E-Mail.
  .
  Oh and since apparently you need one of those nowadays, the Roadmap is public
  (joke aside, that's literally just where I organize upcoming features I'm
  brainstorming about, some might not make it, some might be made that never were
  on it, don't sue me ).

  You might have to click the game after it loads for it to recognize keyboard
  input.

  Notes:
  .
  In 2014 I got Adrian heavily intoxicated and we recorded all the VO fairly ad-
  lib in one hit, feeding him different topics.
  .
  Radjor threw everything together, but then was this 2GB GIT conflict or
  something and I thought maybe people would think it's a commentary on this other
  FMV game that came around around the same time... the whole thing was forgotten
  about for a few years until I tweeted it out and then Jacob the other day was
  all like "lol the world needs to see this just put it on itch.io too"

  Bonus:

  Jurgen's whale music

  ISSUE #4

  Cover - Joe Whitt
  .
  Hello and welcome to Indiepocalypse!
  .
  In its simplest terms, Indiepocalypse is just a bundle of games (common thing)
  packaged with a zine (also common thing) about the aforementioned games and
  comics, reviews and more!
  .
  Each month will feature games by 10 different developers.  Each issue I hope to
  bring together games that explore the breadth of what our art form has to offer.
  .
  Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given,
  each contributor is paid and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.

game: Indifferent Wonder of an Edible Place, The (USA)

developer: Studio Oleomingus

genre: Artgame
description:
  "In my country, history itself is edible.
  .
  Time masticated into tales,
  .
  people digested into stories.
  .
  Places leak mineral flavor.
  .
  Buildings are grated and ground.
  .
  Domes flattened into rotis, Blood boiled into dal.
  .
  The very earth on which we once grew,
  .
  is reabsorbed into the metabolism
  .
  of a nation that has decided to consume itself,
  .
  like an ouroboros.
  .
  A glorious violent meal.
  .
  A spectacular event.
  .
  A prelude to excreting people
  .
  who have been leached of all flavor and all difference.
  .
  The ideal members of a new state.
  .
  Excrement of the old."
  .
  - Mir UmarHassan 1960 (Translated 1983).
  .
  In 1960 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the
  Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of
  Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a
  clean border between the new states.
  .
  Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent
  erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem, where he wrote
  about the vapid consumption of a place and the excretion of a people devoid of
  the flavors of their individual and munificent past.
  .
  With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in
  Ayodhya, and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of
  our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan's original poem.
  .
  The indifferent wonder of an edible place, is our attempt to ponder the violence
  of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of
  history.
  .
  Created with support from Phoenix, Leicester which is supported by Arts Council
  England. And a site-specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix,
  Leicester and at the Video Game Art Gallery in Chicago.
  .
  . . . . . . . . .
  .
  In The Indifferent Wonder Of An Edible Place, Studio Oleomingus manage to ask
  poignant questions about what it means to be a part of erasing history, and what
  can be done - if anything - to intervene. It is particularly heart-wrenching.

developer: Pill Bug Interactive
publisher: Pill Bug Interactive
genre: Simulation
description:
  A toy ecosystem with fully simulated genetics and evolution. Will you tinker
  with DNA or sit back, relax, and see if life finds a way?
  .
  In a universe driven by targets, a faceless corporation employs you to create an
  evolving ecosystem you can never hope to control...
  .
  Intelligent Design: An Evolutionary Sandbox is a god game with fully simulated
  genetics and evolution. Create species of plants, herbivores and carnivores and
  try to control the ever evolving ecosystem. Design and create genetically
  modified organisms, but remember when you start tampering with genetics it is
  hard to undo your mistakes...
  .
  This is a game for people who don't want to be given all the answers. A game for
  people who like to experiment with a simulation, at their own pace, and watch
  what happens.
  .
  Key Features
  .
  Fully modelled genetics and evolution
  .
  The behavior of each organism are determined by their genetics. How tall will a
  plant grow? How fast can an herbivore run? How often does a carnivore seek prey?
  These genetics are passed down generation after generation along with random
  mutations. Evolution is fully simulated, there are no tricks or statistical
  approximations. You are watching life evolve on your computer.
  .
  Science to be Done
  .
  What do all those genes actually do? How is the world score calculated? What
  does world efficiency even mean? Much like a real scientist you will need to
  investigate, analyse and work with other players to try and answer these
  questions. To help you along the way the game outputs data in xml files so you
  can really get your science on.
  .
  Genetic Engineering
  .
  Create your own genetically modified organisms, but be careful, once a genome
  has entered your ecosystem it may be hard to undo the damage ... and are you
  sure you really know what those genes do yet?
  .
  Secrets to Discover
  .
  Who is employing you to create this ecosystem? Why are they doing it? Why are
  you doing it? What are those targets for? The answers to these any many other
  questions are out there, you just need to work together and find them...

  Interactive dialogues about gender, revolution, and resilience.

  Warning: these works use glitchy visual effects that are probably not safe for
  people with photosensitive epilepsy. Please be careful!

  "All the time I'm having to make up stories. Because you are a friend, I can
  confess about it this way, but you know, if you'd interviewed me just like all
  the other interviews by people who are like, 'what is a transgender?' I would
  have had to lie."
  .
  Explanation
  .
  This is a series of works that came out of a residency carried out in early 2018
  in Tokyo, with the Creator Ikusei project, which is supported by the Japanese
  Agency for Cultural Affairs. I adopted research techniques from ethnography and
  history, such as open-ended interviews and participant observation, and
  developed a method of representing the results of this research in a playful and
  interactive form that draws heavily from familiar interaction design patterns
  such as the tamagotchi-style virtual pet and role-playing game multiple-choice
  dialogue systems.
  .
  Some of the development was funded by Making Ways, Sheffield City of Makers.
  .
  All of these pieces are made in Pico-8, a simulation of a 1980s computer that
  never actually existed..

  In late 2018, an innovative new installation was created with funding from Arts
  Council England, using textiles by Anne Smithies and custom-made handheld
  consoles based on the Adafruit PiGRRL Zero. This creates an intimate space and a
  tactile engagement with the material, encouraging a sense of proximity to the
  material. The extensive use of textiles also encourages participation by people
  who might feel turned-off by the signifiers of videogames culture, creating a
  sense of a traditional domestic material culture colliding with avant-garde
  digital aesthetics.

  In the world of "video-games", interaction engineers have spent years rigidly
  defining the specialised and determinate ways that you, a "video-game"
  protagonist, may interact with your world. Here in this guided tour you will
  find them all, glistening with promise, awaiting the click of your mouse and
  ready to edutain you! Please enjoy.

  Except for The Button. The Button is not for you.

  Interactivity: The Interactive Experience is a short meta-narrative experience
  about how our interaction with game worlds is limited by convention, in equal
  parts of awkwardly-funny and oppressive. Explore the gallery in first-person,
  solve a handful of simple puzzles, and find a way to push The Button.
  .
  After several years, the gallery has been refurbished with new details,
  textures, tweaked puzzles, more endings, achievements and original music by
  Miles Tilmann. (The sound track is also available on Steam, along with an
  achievement enabled version of the game.) This new opening of the gallery has
  been described as The Stanley Parable meets Groundhog Day via David Lynch. The
  curator makes no such lofty claims, and advises you to stay behind the red
  cordon ropes at all times.

  Interstellaria is a real time space-exploration sim and crew management game.
  .
  Command a fleet of vessels wandering the galaxy for adventure and profit! You'll
  be forced to make tough decisions as you face hostile starships, crippling space
  anomalies, and intriguing aliens. When your fleet faces certain doom, should you
  direct your crew to make critical repairs, or report to their stations and boost
  your fleet?
  .
  Land your flagship on an alien world, allowing your crew to gather valuable
  resources for you- but be sure to equip them with powerful armor and weapons!
  It's a dangerous universe out there, and although many helpful creatures will
  trade or share valuable information with you, many more will attack on sight!
  .
  Features
  .
  Tactical crew management. Direct crewmen to put out fires, or repair damaged
  equipment. Posting them to their station boosts your fleet's speed and combat
  abilities.
  .
  Customize your ship with helpful stations. Allocate power to important systems
  or simply outfit your ship with lasers and put all power into weapons!
  .
  Your crew eats, sleeps, and needs entertainment. Each one develops unique traits
  throughout the game that help or hurt the mission. Various outfits and weapons
  can be found to customize them further.
  .
  Fleet-based combat. Instead of controlling a single ship, you control multiple
  ships each with their own crew.
  .
  Fully explorable galaxy, no areas are off limits. Each region has unique ships,
  aliens, and mysteries to find.
  .
  Land your ships on planets! Each world is a new experience and has special
  rewards for you and your crew.

game: Inverness Nights (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/I/Inverness Nights (USA)/Inverness Nights (USA).json
developer: kitsubasa
publisher: kitsubasa
genre: Visual Novel
description:
  Tristram Rose appears to be a simple tailor, living and working in Inverness in
  Scotland in the mid-18th century, but then, he's an expert in keeping up
  appearances. In actuality, Tris is immortal, and has lived centuries moving from
  town to town in order to leave any suspicions behind him. He also has a
  remarkable ability: a healing touch which he similarly refrains from using, lest
  he be labelled a witch.
  .
  But when love comes knocking, it's hard to keep cautious. After revealing his
  powers to save the life of his partner Alasdair, Tris finds himself at risk of
  exposure - both as someone with supernatural gifts, and as a man who loves other
  men.
  .
  By noose or by carriage, Tris is leaving Inverness.
  .
  If he flees, Tris will lose everything and be left destitute on the streets, but
  if he stays to earn enough to start a new life, he risks the gallows.
  Fortunately, at that moment a woman in dubious clothes with an equally dubious
  background approaches him requesting an expensive commission.
  .
  Three paths lead forward. Should Tris try to mend his fractured relationship
  with Alasdair, seek help from his enigmatic client, or dive headlong into work
  to fund his escape?
  .
  Help him find his way through his last Inverness nights.
  .
  Over 65,000 words of queer, supernatural-historical fiction
  .
  Three distinct story pathways: prioritise your work, your relationship with
  Alasdair, or befriending your mysterious client
  .
  At least two endings to each path: will you run from your problems, get someone
  killed, or make amends?
  .
  Approximately 90 minutes per playthrough; playing all three paths is
  recommended, for at least 4 hours of gameplay
  .
  More than 20 lush illustrations showcasing the finest in 18th century fashion
  .
  Pastel colour scheme and authentic baroque soundtrack to soothe the dual
  stresses of sewing and exes
  .
  Content Warning: contains gore, sexual references, emotional/physical abuse,
  alcoholism, depictions of racism and homophobia, body horror, discussion of
  gender dysphoria, suicidality, implied suicide, description of dead bodies,
  institutional abuse/police brutality, and profanity. Recommended for ages 16+
  .
  Note: a large part of this game is about the institutional abuse of LGBTQI+
  people, how that abuse is amplified for LGBTQI+ people of colour, and the way it
  filters down into interpersonal abuse and fractured communities. While the
  final/'true' ending of the game is hopeful there are many difficult and
  confronting scenes throughout the story, as well as a number of bad endings.
  Please consider the above warnings carefully before playing.

description:
  'It's Six Random Characters and a Single Floor Dungeon, That's the Whole Game'
  is a first person dungeon crawler. You start with a team of 6 random characters,
  and try to make your way through a single labyrinth. Each character has a Class
  and Race that influence them at the start, and you can find things along the way
  to stay strong as you try and reach the exit. There are 105 classes and 28
  races, but only 4 races per class for a total of 420 characters (each race used
  15 times).
  .
  Some classes fill a similar niche, such as the Cleric, Healer, and High Priest
  all being Devotion-focused healing classes. They differ in their unique skills,
  such as the Cleric's passive that increases their Devotion stat as a battle goes
  on, the Healer's 'Simple Labor' skill that lets them weakly heal someone without
  using up their turn, or the High Priest's 'Desperation' skill that fully heals
  an ally while stunning themself.
  .
  Races range from the typical like Dwarves (+30% Hp, Armor; -30% Speed, Evasions)
  to the less common like the flashy Kitsune (+30% STR/AGI/LOG/DEV/SPD; three
  times as likely to be targeted by enemy attacks) to the unusual like Slimes
  (Regens 10% Hp & Mp each turn, +100% Speed, can acts twice each turn; cannot use
  any Equipment).
  .
  There are Toilets to scavenge equipment from, Computers to print out more Skill
  Licenses from, and Vending Machines to buy consumables from. There are also
  monsters, and a single door. Do your best to make it to the exit!
  .
  There is no persistent progress or saving; each run is its own thing. Once you
  beat the boss or all party members die, that's the end.
  .
  This is not a story-rich game or one where much information is given at all.
  This is not a roguelike where you can get a "God-run" and everything goes great.
  This is a game where you and your group is lost in a dungeon, and there is no
  one and nothing to save you but yourself.
  .
  While each dungeon is just one floor, it's expansive enough to make getting lost
  easy. A single run shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.
  .
  The demo only has a single map and layout, but is otherwise the same experience.
  There's also a free Mac build, since I know some people play my games on Macs
  but since the Catalina update I can't guarantee it works on those operating
  systems.

  It's definitely a refreshing, thorough and intricate take on the genre. It's

  STORY
  .
  After countless years of careful space observation, the enormous telescope
  Chandra 17 suddenly locates a solar system quite similar to our own. As all
  earthly observatories turned their attention towards this new discovery, a
  signal of artificial origin is detected from deep within the system.
  .
  Reaction was immediate and a mission plan was conceived. No expense was spared
  in the construction of a massive space probe. It was designed and equipped to be
  ideally suited for the ultimate challenge: to meet and study extraterrestrial
  sentient life-forms. Equal care was taken with the crew. Only the most prominent
  scientists were selected and trained to ideally represent planet Earth.
  Everything was perfectly planned and success was certain. Yet somehow,
  everything has gone terribly wrong...
  .
  Now, imagine being jolted awake by an emergency alarm. As your surroundings come
  into focus, you realize you were deep in cryogenic sleep on a vast space probe.
  But why you are there is an elusive memory. Disoriented, you rush to the control
  room searching for answers. Once there you learn from the ship's AI that not
  only have you been asleep for decades, but you are also the last surviving
  member of the probe's crew.
  .
  To make matters worse, the probe is severely damaged by a disastrous impact with
  a passing meteoroid swarm. First, you must make repairs. Not only is your own
  survival at stake, but you need to find out what happened to the crew and why
  you alone survived.
  .
  Are You Prepared to
  .
  step into the spacesuit of Rachel Manners and find out why she was the sole
  survivor of this ill-fated expedition?
  .
  utilize an ingenious MOBOT - a mobile robot designed for planetary exploration
  to investigate this solar system and all its wonders?
  .
  solve the mystery of the mission's failure and locate the missing crew?
  .
  travel to six unique planets and uncover their secrets?
  .
  solve puzzles, gather clues and communicate with the most temperamental
  artificial intelligence ever designed?
  .
  Are you prepared for... J.U.L.I.A.
  .
  And there is more!
  .
  You'll get a beautiful hintbook, soundtrack and one more game called J.U.L.I.A:
  Untold.

  Jet Buster is a 90s-styled anthromorphic shmup, going back to the unusual

  shmups of the early 90s that were going against the standard spaceship
  .
  fare at the time.
  .

  .
  The year is 2182, it's been almost a decade since the Zeno Wars have
  .
  ended, with the threat no more, civlizations all across the galaxy have

  humanoid animals living on what humans named, Earth "J", the home planet
  .
  of none other than Makoto Kitsune, the rather odd Fox woman who helped
  .
  win the Zeno Wars. And she's... a J-Pop idol?
  .
  However, peace didn't last long as... some mean-spirited animals clearly
  .
  don't want her singing! Her tours being constantly ruined by some angry
  .
  people, Makoto got mad, so mad, she became a crimesweeper, going on a
  .
  personal vendetta against those who ruined her musical tours. This
  .
  musical, is gonna be full of bullets.
  .
  GAMEPLAY:
  .
  Jet Buster is a more accessible shoot-em'up compared to the previous
  .
  Grybanser Fox titles, where Normal is 100% serious about being Normal.
  .
  Of course, there's always an Expert mode for those who are looking
  .
  forward for a bigger challenge.
  .
  So simply, pick a character, shoot things, pick up coins OR transform
  .
  coins into gold for those juicy EXTRA POINTS! And collect gold, to
  .
  unlock more content.

  Fight the Coronavirus during the Wuhan quarantine.
  .
  A game written during COVID-19 pandemic, telling a sad story of struggle,
  tenacity, and also hope with some bits of public inconsistencies too...
  .
  It is a tactical memory game, built as a documentary,  where you Follow Doctor
  Li, and relive the early days of the Coronavirus epidemic.
  .
  The outbreak from Huanan Seafood Market,
  .
  The courage of the quarantined population in Wuhan ("Wuhan, Jia You !"),
  .
  #IamNotAVirus and the surge of ordinary racism throughout the world
  .
  The "Diamond Princess"  confinment,
  .
  and more...
  .
  Contain and cure 5 different types of viruses, only with your memory and a
  little bit of strategy.
  .
  Don't hesitate to play, comment, share and follow us @JiayouMemoVirus !
  .
  What is coming next :
  .
  The story mode is pretty much complete. However, depending on the reception,
  more might come :
  .
  Custom levels
  .
  Bigger resolution
  .
  Smartphone and steam versions
  .
  The story behind the game :
  .
  The idea of the game emerged on the 2nd of January 2020, 10 days after the
  beginning of Wuhan quarantine.
  .
  We had been witnessing the early days of the epidemic unfolding, such as the
  quarantine, the prejudices against Chinese-looking associated with the
  #IamNotAVirus hashtag, the iconic death of Li Wenliang...  We realized that
  there was a story to be told.
  .
  But a few weeks later, we also experienced a kind of denial in our countries :
  "It is just a flu". There was a message to pass!
  .
  The first edition was published on the 11th of March, 5 days before French
  Confinement. But also 3 weeks too late to be of any use for prevention...
  However we still thought that the main message of encouragement "Jia you!" was
  more important than ever.
  .
  In the following weeks, we kept improving the game. And the 10th of May, the
  last day of our confinement, it was important to us to add a new  layer of
  narration through the achievements : retell our own experience of the
  confinement. With a 7-weeks shift, it creates a surprising symetry with Wuhan's.
  .
  As we publish this version, the 10th of June, players might be fed up with the
  Coronavirus and prefer to move on. But maybe that, in a few month or in a few
  years, it will be interesting, pleasant, or even salutary to come back  to
  relive those crazy months.
  .
  Read more about the "Story behind the game" in the devlog. (More is coming....)

  Just Another Day at the Office is a light-hearted action game with musings on
  the meaning of work. You play the role of a disgruntled office worker. Years and
  years in the same boring office, with the same boring jokes and the same
  paperwork. You feel your mind slowly dying. What are you doing it all for? Is
  this all there is to life?
  .
  And suddenly you snap. This is not how it's going to end.
  .
  And that's how it starts...
  .
  Let loose, you try to escape from the office, using whatever weapons you find -
  which means constructing Molotov cocktails from whiskey bottles and robbing the
  art department of their spray cans for some redecorating. Along the way you'll
  get confronted by police, bankers, and finally maybe even save the world - or
  fail miserably?
  .
  You can even take a break from the action to watch the people in the world talk
  or think, and read a few books.

  Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy is 16-bit styled RPG featuring turn-based
  combat, plenty of exploration, and a funky soundtrack to pump you up. This is an
  officially licensed game based on the live-action monster wrestling group Kaiju
  Big Battel, who have been performing their Godzilla-meets-WWE act for over 20
  years.
  .
  Designed for Kaiju fans and newcomers alike, Fighto Fantasy takes players on a
  quest across time and space as they work to undo damage caused by the evil Dr.
  Cube as he rampages through history in search of fame and glory. With seven main
  playable heroes (and a secret one to unlock), players explore six time periods
  and punch out dozens of deadly monsters.
  .
  All the world is watching as the Kaiju Big Battel Title Fight is about to begin:
  The diabolical Dr. Cube vs. the patriotic pugilist, American Beetle! Things take
  a sudden turn when Cube pulls out a secret weapon that rips open portals into
  history. Now it's up to the Kaiju Heroes to pursue Cube across the centuries,
  from Egypt to Rome to Russia and beyond! Is the mad doctor pursuing dangerous
  artifacts lost to time, or does he just want to deface famous landmarks with his
  own ugly mug?
  .
  Combat: No random encounters here; touch enemy NPCs on the map to trigger turn-
  based battles. Each of the seven main heroes has their own strengths and
  weaknesses.
  .
  Side stories: When you're not chasing Dr. Cube through time, take a minute to
  help out some locals. Slay a musclebound mummy, rescue lost Kaiju heroes, adopt
  cats!
  .
  Map abilities: Each hero has a unique ability to interact with environmental
  objects, unlocking hidden paths and secret treasures.
  .
  Difficulty selection: Easy Mode for a relaxed experience, Normal Mode for
  players who want some tense fights, and Hard Mode for players looking for more
  deadly dangers.
  .
  12+ hours of RPG adventure.
  .

  Can you survive in the city of Trenn?
  .
  In this fantasy themed, turn-based city simulation game, players will need to
  use their wits to see it through to the end! Your citizens will look to your
  leadership when successful, or they may abandon the town when you make massive
  mistakes. The choice is yours.
  .
  Your main objective: to build a prosperous town. To achieve this, you must
  recruit villagers and create a thriving city as you contend with world events
  like monster attacks and refugees, market upswings (or recessions), and trade
  deals with neighboring towns. Choose from various businesses
  .
  such as: hotels, stables, and weapon makers! Each of these contributes a
  different purpose to Trenn and over time: will help you grow your empire.
  .
  Kalling Kingdom incorporates a simulated marketplace for players to take
  advantage of. Understanding just the right time to invest and sell could
  drastically alter the events to come. Organization, a keen eye, and a little
  risk could lead to big results when it comes to funding your town.
  .
  Do you have what it takes to lead?
  .
  Multiple types of businesses to build
  .
  Marketplace to manage
  .
  Defend your town against monsters
  .
  Recruit villagers of all types to grow your numbers
  .
  Decide on risky moral dilemmas

  discovery of a mysterious cult embedded within the expedition. Now Rae and Alex,
  alongside heroes Ruth, Gwen and other allies, must investigate and discover the
  truth behind the cult and the Deepforge Expedition before it's too late.

  Knowledge is power. By a sudden circumstance, everything you read and learn
  becomes true in front of your eyes. When a gruesome verse written on a wall in
  blood turns into reality, do you want to keep reading? Knowledge is painful.
  .
  Korpus is a first-person horror game in which you have been sent to evaluate an
  abandoned house in Eastern Europe as a real estate agent. Uncover the houses
  past as you learn what horrors it hides.
  .
  Features
  .
  The house changes based on the things you know. You just learned that the dark
  hallway has one more door in it and a vengeful ghost is coming after you? There
  is now.
  .
  The game is an unconventional horror game perceived from the first perspective.
  There is no combat - all the monsters must be dealt with indirect means, either
  by avoiding, hiding or something cleverer.
  .
  The ghosts lurking in the dark corners of the house work
  .
  in different ways. Some are hostile, some or not, but only one thing is clear:
  they will not make your journey to the source of the madness any easier.
  .
  In order to solve the secrets of the house, you need to figure out how the house
  works. Is one specific bookshelf in your way and need it to disappear? Read a
  note that contradicts its existence.

  ATTENTION: The game requires .NET 3.5 framework to work properly.

  This is not a horror game about things that jump out and scare you. This is a
  horror game about feeling lost and being worried about dying instantly to what's
  around the next corner.
  .
  This game does not care about what came before or what comes after. There is
  only the labyrinth.
  .
  This game has enemies that you cannot beat, only outrun. They are slow, they
  aren't smart, but they are patient, they are many, and they are powerful. Some
  will be very obvious with their presence, and some will blend in almost
  perfectly with their surroundings. Make sure to save when you have breathing
  room.
  .
  Note: There is an ongoing bounty where the first person to have video evidence
  that they've beaten this game will get every public project I have made and will
  make for free. I must emphasize that you should not feel bad for trying and
  failing, as this game (and most of my other games) is meant to be a test against
  the hubris of humanity. The bounty has been claimed, but best of luck to those
  who still challenge the maze! Now that it's been claimed, I've brought back the
  "no monsters" version for those who'd prefer to climb without worry.
  .
  [Side note: this game engine (Smile Game Builder) is not very flexible so just
  ignore most of the menu (assessed through the Esc key) and use it only to save
  your progress. Also, during my first test my antivirus forced it closed to scan
  it, so if it does that just the once for you please don't send bug reports about
  that; it's pretty out of my hands. Also, there is no soundtrack; I was listening
  to this playlist during most of development and I recommend it.]

genre: Card Game;Action;Role Playing;Strategy
description:
  The Land of Glass is a card game with a twist: speed. It's CCG meets action RPG,
  combining card collecting and deck building with frantic combat. Choose your
  heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.
  .
  A Real-Time Card Game
  .
  The Land of Glass is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back
  and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy
  of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The
  monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.
  .
  Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your
  foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady
  stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice,
  explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents
  down for some needed breathing room.
  .
  Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the
  playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning
  storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find,
  and experimenting is key to survival.
  .
  A Character-Driven Story
  .
  A knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete. A misfit believes he has ended
  the world. A mage searches for answers. A blacksmith demands revenge.
  .
  The portals were supposed to make Vitrerran a better place. They were supposed
  to save the continent, to unite a divided people. Instead, they brought ruin.
  Instead, they brought monsters.
  .
  The Land of Glass is an RPG with eight protagonists spanning four campaigns.
  Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront
  his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that
  threatens to eat the continent. While set against an apocalyptic backdrop, The
  Land of Glass tells stories that are both personal and small-it is a character
  study first and an epic fantasy second.
  .
  Because not every quest is noble, and not every world is worth saving.
  .

genre: Action;Adventure;Platformer
description:
  Last Knight is over-the-top non-stop jousting action in a beautiful brutal
  fantasy world! It comes with bucketloads of content and is inspired by
  outstanding third-person platformers like Crash Bandicoot. It uses the Unreal
  Engine to bring it all to live...
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  OVER-THE-TOP JOUSTING! - Countless enemies had been shot, hacked and slashed in
  the history of games. Now it is time to ram a wooden lance in some gut, send
  your foes flying, and watch them bite the dust! Body parts ripping off, ragdoll
  horse physics, and destructive environments included.
  .
  A BEAUTIFUL BRUTAL WORLD - Dive into a magical fantasy world full of treasures
  and adventures! Don't be fooled by the cartoony looks: here, simply bumping into
  a silly wooden fence spells a sudden end to your hero's life. If you fancy dying
  in a more heroic way, how about getting swallowed by a giant toad, falling into
  a lava pit, exploding from eating too much turkey, getting impaled by a Hitler
  Snowman, or just getting lit on fire by a dragon!
  .
  BUCKETLOADS OF CONTENT - Divided into three major parts - the Story Mode, the
  Endless Journey Mode and the Rogue Rider Mode - this game has a lot to offer and
  there is always something new to accomplish, find, or unlock. Power-ups,
  characters, view modes, mutators, quests, game mode variations, randomly
  generated hats, you name it! Did you ever wish to be a skeleton king with a
  fancy wig riding over rainbows on a flower-pooping pink unicorn? It's all up to
  you in this game!
  .
  INSPIRED BY CRASH BANDICOOT - Good third-person platformers were always hard to
  find on PC, when consoles sport countless shining examples: the first Crash
  Bandicoot titles, Spyro, Ratchet & Clank, and Super Mario were all a big
  inspiration for Last Knight. This game kicks it up a notch with non-stop
  jousting action, no-health instant death, procedurally-generated worlds, as well
  as custom-crafted levels with Knightmare levels in-between. To top it off, the
  new Rogue Rider Mode pushes it all into a rogue-like direction, and if you don't
  like third-person view, try playing in first-person mode!

  The world of Rosarah is haunted by the ancient past. Grand civilizations fell to

  .
  They are the Librarians: the guardians of ancient knowledge and history,
  protectors of the 8 magic spell books which were originally used by evil to

  deep in well-guarded Libraries, in order to defend Rosarah once again from
  tyranny.
  .
  Exploration: Explore the vast and open world of Rosarah, investigating its many
  secrets. Find hidden treasures, collectible upgrades, and interesting landmarks.
  You are free to tackle the challenges in whatever order you like, as it is
  possible to explore the entire game with just the tools you have available at
  the beginning of the game.
  .
  Solve Puzzles: Uncover the secrets buried in the eight hidden Libraries
  throughout Rosarah. Each is riddled with dangerous traps, and puzzles that seek
  to trick any who might enter uninvited. If you are able to navigate them, each
  contains a powerful spell to add to your set of abilities.
  .
  Battle Enemies: Take on fourteen powerful bosses, as well as minibosses, and a
  host of fiendish foes determined to reign destruction across Rosarah. Use many
  different strategies to fight, making use of an arsenal of weapons and magical
  attacks. Find new abilities, and upgrade your abilities by finding hidden
  treasures.
  .
  Legend Quest: For those looking for an extra challenge, Legend Quest is included
  in v5.0.0. With this game mode, the entirety of Rosarah is changed. Enemies are
  stronger and have new abilities. The overworld includes new perilous foes and
  traps. Every Library has a transformed layout and new mechanics, requiring you
  to use every tool at your disposal.
  .

  ideal introductory course to the Japanese language!

  attack will be reflected and used against you. It's a learn & live situation!

  Most songs can probably be categorized as chill/downtempo, and revolve around
  dark/depressing themes, with a few rays of hope every now and then.

  Lingotopia is a language learning game about being lost in a city where you
  don't speak the language. Learn Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian,
  Spanish and more! You play a little girl shipwrecked on the shores of a strange
  island. In order to get back home you'll need to explore the island and talk to
  its inhabitants. Sadly, no one speaks your language! You'll have to learn words
  one at a time to decipher what these strange creatures are saying.
  .
  How does it work?
  .
  Explore a lovingly handcrafted city.
  .
  Click on objects in the environment and your guide will teach you the word for
  them.
  .
  Learn words by talking to the city's inhabitants.
  .
  Voice recordings by native speakers teach you the correct pronunciation.
  .
  Learning a language with a different script? Toggle between the romanised and
  native script at any time.
  .
  Words you know can be translated when they appear during conversations. So, the
  more words you know, the more you'll begin to feel at home in this strange
  place. You might even be able to find a way off the island!
  .
  Will this really help me learn a language
  .
  Yes! Learning words is the most important part of language learning. You can
  learn several hundred words by playing Lingotopia. As the game only translates
  individual words and not entire sentences, you also learn word order and grammar
  by playing. All dialogue in the game is tied to the setting and story, so you
  have a reason to decipher each and every sentence.
  .
  What languages can I learn?
  .
  The official languages are Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian,
  Spanish. You can learn English in each of these languages. There are also over
  20 "unofficial languages", these don't have voice recordings and I won't be able
  to vouch for the accuracy of the translations. I will keep an up to date list of
  the included unofficial languages at https://www.lingoludo.com/lingotopia/.
  .
  Enjoy the game!

  Quite the long year, wasn't it?
  .
  Feels like a lot happened and nothing happened all at the same time.
  .
  It'll be good to get the year behind us, don't you think?
  .
  Ah, sorry, I'm just rambling. We're almost there.
  .
  little boats of farewell is a 10-minute point-and-click adventure about bidding
  farewell to things you want to leave behind. Stroll along the River of Goodbyes,
  where people from all over come to release boats carrying their farewells.
  .
  Think about what you want to say goodbye to this year and let your own boat
  drift down the river.
  .
  In little boats of farewell, there is the option to share a memory of your visit
  to the river with others who visit the river themselves. Please note that while
  your physical presence along with your boat is shared, what you bid farewell to
  is not.
  .
  There is also a printable card version of the boat if you would like to
  physically write down what you want to bid farewell to. Please download the zip
  file for the print template and printing instructions.

  Get Nyah Home
  .
  Nyah is walking home from school when she's suddenly cast into an uncanny world
  where dangerous spirits linger restlessly in bottomless canyons, icy caves, and
  moonlit deserts. Play as Nyah and her spirit light in tandem as you immerse
  yourself in this foreboding, atmospheric landscape. Will Nyah use her new found
  light to find her way home or will she lose her way amongst the many dangers
  that roam in the moonlight?
  .
  Simple Controls, Complex Gameplay:
  .
  Nyah can walk on the ground and collect treasures while her light can fly in any
  direction - you control them both at the same time. Forming a telekinetic beam
  between them, you'll create a powerful connection that can swing Nyah to new
  heights, destroy barriers, thwart spirits and light the way to secret locations.
  Your coordination with these two characters is key, as disembodied spirits can
  appear without warning and hurt Nyah or her light. You'll learn their unique
  play style intuitively and quickly as fresh challenges emerge to test you in the
  wilderness.
  .
  Discover Dozens of Unique Items
  .
  Collect dozens of unique treasures in Nyah's lunchbox that reveal memories from
  Nyah's past and rearrange them however you like. Decide which items to keep with
  you on your journey and which to offer to the mysterious spirit cat Roadkill,
  who can unlock secret challenge levels with special items.

  About the Game Dev

  How's it going? My name is Belle, but I go by Amaiguri basically everywhere
  online. I make adoraBELLE things to touch people's hearts! I'm a college student
  studying Game Design--with a subfocus on narrative and systems. I made this game
  and its world in my spare time all by myself, more or less, but I'm not very
  good at programming... You should follow me on Instagram and get to know me
  more. If you have any questions or comments about this scrappy little
  experience, I'm happy to talk about my game endlessly--including lore questions,
  design questions, and bug-squashing!

  WARNING: Epileptic seizures associated with increased sensitivity to light are
  Possible. Some people may experience seizures when exposed to flashes of light
  and flashing images that appear in a video game. People who have not previously
  experienced such attacks may not be aware of their illness. A reasonable
  restriction of the game audience is recommended.

  The game takes place in a house where previously there were terrible events. You
  have to repeatedly wander through the same corridor, in order to uncover the
  causes of insanity and understand who you are. Be patient, and the house will
  open previously locked doors and show you frightening memories of the past. The
  narrative of the story is transmitted through the environment. Each item tells a
  story, relying on your imagination. Only the player decides to reveal the idea
  of the game and be in the center of events, escape or pass it as a room of fear.

  If you answered yes to any of the above, do I have news for you because
  Locomancer lets you PLAY WITH AND RIDE MODEL TRAINS!
  .
  (Also if you answered no to all of the above, come on, we all know you're lying
  to yourself and everyone you love. Take a break from the wave shooters and play
  with some trains.)
  .
  Locomancer is a toy box style model train simulator for touch enabled SteamVR
  headsets. It allows you to build layouts of varying complexity and even defy
  what is physically possible in fake virtual reality (reality).
  .
  Featuring:
  .
  Multiple locomotives including steam and diesel engines
  .
  A variety of rail cars including a fully functional cannon car
  .
  Straight track, curved track, inclined track, loop de loops, and more!
  .
  Various pieces of scenery to add detail your layouts
  .
  Plus, with support for custom scenery, you can bring models created by yourself
  or the community into the game for even further customization. The possibilities
  are nearly endless*!
  .
  Fully embracing the physicality of touch enabled virtual reality you are legally
  required to build layouts piece by piece, tree by tree. Then, once complete you
  must remotely operate your trains with a replica DC control panel or hop in the
  cab of any of the available locomotives and drive them with physical levers,
  knobs, and dials! They even burst in to flames when they crash, you can't say
  that about your real model trains can you?
  .
  Oh...you can? I'd get that checked out if I were you.
  .
  So what are you waiting for? Become The Locomancer!
  .
  Yes, you are the Locomancer. Was that not clear? It's like a train wizard.
  You're like the babe with the power, but instead of voodoo it's train magic.
  Also, there's no magic dance, but you can still dance to twenty-six minutes of
  sweet big band jazz by Nathan Boler if you want to.
  .
  *The possibilities are totally endful, but there's still a lot you can do.

  Short Description
  .
  Long Gone Days is a 2D modern-day military RPG set in our current times, with a
  focus on language and cultural barriers, inspired by classic dystopian
  literature and visual novels.
  .
  After being deployed to his first mission, Rourke leaves The Core's base for the
  very first time, only to discover the dark truth about the operation he's part
  of and the consequences of deserting an inescapable war.
  .
  With no place to call home now, he must prevent the war from spreading any
  further, forming strong bonds along the way that will forever change his life.
  .
  Communication is Key: As Long Gone Days is set in the real world, you'll
  encounter several language barriers. Recruit interpreters in order to
  communicate with others.
  .
  Keep Morale High: Choose dialogue options wisely as they impact your party
  members' Morale, affecting how they perform during battles. While doing so, keep
  in mind every character has different personality traits and motivations.
  .
  Sniper Mode: Long Gone Days has two battle systems. Using Rourke's rifle, spot
  your enemies and take down your targets.
  .
  No Random Encounters: Long Gone Days features front-view turn-based battles with
  body-targeting system, and every battle is directly related to the plot.

game: Loot Rascals (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/L/Loot Rascals (USA)/Loot Rascals (USA).json
developer: Hollow Ponds
publisher: Hollow Ponds
genre: Role Playing
description:
  Explore an outlandish outer space, gather Loot Cards, and fight your way to The
  Thing Below in this innovative and offbeat strategy roguelike.
  .
  Beat up strange baddies and win Loot Cards which give you special abilities.
  Choosing which to equip requires strategic thinking - the way you lay them out
  is crucial, and some must be sacrificed because cards are also the precious
  resources you need to heal and use powerful abilities.
  .
  Careful though because baddies can loot you! The cards they steal drop into
  other players' games. When you defeat an Elite Baddie you'll get another
  player's card: will you return it or keep it for yourself?
  .
  Either way, prepare for a visit from that player's Holographic Helper to shower
  you with thanks or terrible vengeance - Loot Rascals is a tale of friendship,
  loss, and redemption!
  .
  Every game is different in this procedurally generated roguelike: gather Loot
  Cards, show the Thing Below who's boss, and fly Big Barry to victory!
  .

  the Ozarks.
  .
  As the unfortunate boy who fell into a sinkhole in the 1880s, use your trusty
  lantern and vivid imagination to survive the dangers that dwell deep in the
  heart of the Lost Cave. But beware - not only does the cave become more and more
  treacherous as you struggle to escape, but the boy's prolonged isolation serves
  as a catalyst to his overactive imagination- causing reality and fantasy to
  become indiscernible. To make matters worse, several threatening messages found
  throughout the cave suggest you might not be alone in the cave after all. In the
  present day, join the mysterious tour guide and attempt to shed more light on
  the Lost Cave's enigmatic history.
  .
  Will an outlaw's bias, a young boy's imagination, and a tour guide's research be
  enough to help you discern the truth hidden inside the Lost Cave?
  .
  The Lost Cave of the Ozarks features:
  .
  * Unique puzzle-solving platforming rife with exploration, sparks of action, and
  several hidden secrets to discover
  .
  * Play as characters from the present day and the 1880s to experience the
  ambiguously grim history of the Lost Cave
  .
  * Story-rich narrative weaves together three mysterious characters' stories -
  each with an unreliable point-of-view - that not only takes you on a journey to
  the past and present, but also from the wooded Ozark Mountains and caves, to the
  pirate-infested high seas, the majestic Mount Olympus, eerie Egyptian temples,
  and more!
  .
  * Secret alternate story endings
  .
  * Hand-painted, stylized visuals with diverse settings and characters
  .
  * Fantastic, emotional, and dynamic soundtrack sets the mood and fluidly
  transforms along with the player's progress
  .

  cues

  Once Upon a time, there was an unhappy child. All they wanted in life, was to be
  happy, and in their dreams, they were. However, all dreams must come to an end
  someday.
  .
  Lost Dreams is a game created for My First Game Jam.
  .
  The game is very short, only half an hour to an hour long, but it was my first
  venture into creating almost all of the assets used in the game.
  .
  You play a child, who is on a quest to wake up from their blissful dream while
  the inhabitants of their dream world try to, half heartedly, stand in their way.
  The majority of the game are simple puzzles, with atmospheric music and surreal
  inhabitants to the world.
  .
  The game features include:
  .
  Multiple endings (4 bad endings, one normal, and one true ending)
  .
  A rhythm-based battle system
  .
  New Game+
  .
  Various puzzles and riddles
  .
  Warnings for the game include:
  .
  Mention of suicide
  .
  Mentions of abuse and neglect
  .
  Body horror
  .
  Scopophobia
  .
  Trypophobia
  .
  Loud noises
  .
  While I personally am not completely happy with the outcome of the game, I am
  proud of the fact that it is a project that I have actually finished, and am
  looking forward to the next game jam I join.

description:
  Love Hues! is a university-based visual novel packed with both character and
  world secrets. You'll be playing as Skyler (changeable name and pronouns) and
  navigate your first few months at Falls West University, where you'll meet 5
  romanceable - or befriendable! - characters who hide certain truths about
  themselves and the world around them. This is the full version of the game!
  .
  Love Hues! features 41 unique endings, 5 routes, 228,000+ words, and 32+ CGs.

  Characters
  .
  Every character's True ending can be unlocked whether you play their platonic or
  romantic route.
  .
  Toby: 19 years old, they/them. Toby's full of energy and keen to kick off their
  studies in post-secondary - and to join Falls' soccer team! They're troubled by
  their past with a certain other Falls student...
  .
  James: 20 years old, he/him. James is a flirty and cheerful student who is
  determined to become a doctor. He seems to be struggling with his academics and
  well-being lately. Loves archeology and is close with Devlin.
  .
  Nova: 18 years old, she/her. Nova's your neighbor in the dorms, and she's often
  out researching Falls' strange past. She's dedicated to and protective of her
  friends, especially Ava. She may be more entwined in Falls' secrets than she
  tells most folx. (Please note: Nova's route is only unlocked after 1+ ending(s)
  has been achieved!)
  .
  Devlin: 20 years old, he/him. Devlin is the students' union volunteer
  coordinator but tends to seem impersonal. He's passionate about the union's
  success and works tirelessly despite rumors of its financial troubles.
  .
  Ava: 18 years old, she/her. Ava rarely appears to be on campus and tends to be
  anxious and withdrawn. Knows more about Falls and the 'Curiosity' than most.
  .
  (Please note that Ava's route requires all True endings to be unlocked.)
  .
  Choose wisely...
  .
  Certain choices in routes will add new scenes to other routes you've already
  experienced or will unlock secret content. Learn as much as you can about Falls'
  true origins by exploring the game from every angle, and see if you can
  understand what everyone means when they whisper the Curiosity's name...
  .
  Pick your appearance and pronouns!
  .
  Pick the main character appearance you like + your pronouns - you can romance or
  befriend anyone in the cast regardless of your choice!
  .

  Overview
  .
  Play through an engaging and emotional story set in a deep world full of its own
  original mythology and history. The universe and all its inhabitants have been
  reincarnated, but the world's structure isn't how it should be. Those who can
  dream are considered cursed in this society. You'll solve the mysteries behind
  the Dreamers, and even enter into their Dreamspaces for unique, interesting
  areas to explore.
  .
  Take advantage of the Dual Soul class system, switching between Pure and Veil
  classes in the heat of battle, to conquer challenging enemies and bosses.
  .
  Note: The game has an optional 'Lucid Awakening 1 Primer' in-game that will tell
  you everything you need to know about Lucid Awakening 1. This way you can start
  off with Lucid Awakening 2.

  Story Overview
  .
  Dual Soul System
  .
  Zeke, Silas, and Terra have the ability to transform into various 'Souls.' These
  forms are actually the result of their bodies recreating past lives they lived
  in previous Epochs.
  .
  Each of the three characters has their own unique set of Pure and Veil Souls
  they will obtain throughout the story. You can assign one Pure and one Veil Soul
  outside of battle, then freely switch between the two in battle.
  .
  All enemies are also either Pure or Veil. Souls and enemies deal more damage to
  the opposing alignment but deal less damage to the same alignment. They will
  also receive more damage from the opposing alignment and take less damage from
  the same alignment.

  Everyone is a suspect. Unmask their lies. Choose one to purge.
  .
  Lucifer Within Us asks you to solve short, player-directed, story rich mysteries
  with your wits, making observations and deductions in a world of daemonic
  possession and invasive soul-scanning technology.
  .
  From the creator of The Shrouded Isle.
  .
  Investigate timelines. Question your suspects. Watch their movements and
  testimonies closely, as the reconstruction may be based on lies. Use
  contradictions and clues to form your own hypothesis. Who is lying and why? Who
  is possessed? You must decide what is the truth for yourself, based on the
  evidence presented.
  .
  Real mystery-solving. No hidden plot twists, no QTEs, no random puzzles or mini-
  games, just you and the information. Don't just act like a detective -- BE a
  detective in 3 murder cases. Finding the murderer will require true
  understanding of the case, not just following the story.
  .
  Banish daemonic A.I. Enter the minds of citizens to gain insight into what they
  don't want you to know. Dig through their subconscious and accuse the guilty in
  order to cast out their daemons, for the good of the Inquisition. Any damage
  done to a citizen's psyche as a result of quarantine, exorcism, or
  rehabilitation is a consequence of their own immorality.
  .
  Expose the False Utopia. Through centuries of indoctrination, humanity is taught
  to think pure thoughts and speak true words, untainted by falsehoods and
  delusions. Yet beneath this facade of purity, you find dark desires stir deep
  within people's hearts, yearning for release.
  .
  As a digital exorcist working for the Church of Ain Soph's Inquisition, it is
  your duty to find sinners and ensure continued harmony. Digital daemons corrupt
  the network cause human hosts to act on secret desires and sins, even unto
  murder. Discover the One Truth to determine which citizens are infected and
  exorcise the possessed.
  .
  Built on the rubble of the Old World, the last human city has become a utopia of
  progress, digitization, and art. The Church guides citizens towards advancement
  and Truth with the aid of a digital consciousness network.
  .
  Use all of the tools at your disposal to find the truth, wherever it may hide...
  and beware the lies you tell yourself.

  Overview

  A Bird's peaceful summer slumber is disturbed by the majestic call of a
  mysterious Owl. Enticed to swallow the last piece of the waning Moon, Bird is
  blown far from its Golden Gate home.

  Re-awaken shadowy forests and bring life back to sparkling lakes. Discover

  Bring each world to life, revealing Austin Wintory's haunting, enchanting score.
  .
  Brought to you by Funomena's uniquely diverse team of veteran developers
  (Journey, Flower, Boom Blox, The Sims 2), Luna is an interactive fable about
  learning by the light of unexpected mistakes.
  .
  Luna started off in partnership with Intel and their RealSense Camera
  technology, but as the project evolved, and hand-tracked VR controllers began to
  emerge, we partnered with Oculus to bring the game to the Touch. The non-VR PC
  version was released shortly after the original launch date. The storybook
  edition later updated the core game with a voice over narrative & localized
  subtitles to further elucidate Luna's heartfelt story.
  .
  You can find out more about how the idea for Luna came to be through these
  tweets by Robin Hunicke. Luna is a very personal game for Robin, and we hope
  it'll touch you like it has already touched others across the world.

  literary chunks." Gameranx

  it, the more beautiful and rewarding the world will look..." 8.6 - The Nerd Mag

  Mable & The Wood is a Metroidvania where you can take the form of the bosses
  that you kill, changing how you're able to explore the interconnected world.
  It's also a Metroidvania where you don't have to kill anyone.
  .
  The strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you
  will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save
  this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose
  their meaning with time...

  When the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The
  Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you
  might kill everyone.

  Will you banish the darkness, or will you become it?
  .
  COMBAT IS MOVEMENT

  The way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable
  shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to
  your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.

  You can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing
  creatures extends your power.

  the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)

  I was perfect, and titanic, and serene. But then, as I moved through the cold
  abyss, I saw a light. And as I came near, I saw something... wonderful.

  I love stories and video games. Every day my kids are making up their own
  characters. It's a shame not to be able to share these creations with more
  people, but fortunately this has changed.
  .
  "Make your adventure" will allow you, even without programing skills, to make
  your narrative video game in a few minutes. Just Make, Share & Play!
  .
  Take your story, select your characters, write the dialogues, link everything
  and save it. From that moment you can share with your friends, students or
  customers a video game that tells your story.
  .
  And It's FREE!
  .
  How can that be?
  .
  If you want to share a story with your friends, involve your children's
  creativity with new technologies, make a newsgame, high impact advertisement, a
  meme or catch your children/students' attention for learning more while they
  play, this is your tool. Download the "Maker" and "Player" package from the link
  below and Make It Real!
  .
  There is no restriction with the user license if your purpose is non-commercial.
  If you want an extra income, you have a few restrictions.
  .
  If we reach the online repository stretch goal, you could also share your
  stories in our web and, if you become a featured creator, you can earn money by
  sharing them.
  .
  How does it work?
  .
  Download the "Maker and Player package" below and follow the video tutorial.
  .
  What is the next step
  .
  We currently have a prototype that is already functional but with lack of
  content to play (characters, skins, sounds, music, etc ...).
  .
  "Create Your Adventure" is focused on content. You can see the characters
  included in the official package by now, but we need more assets and about more
  related topics.
  .
  The more resources we put at your disposal to create, the more we will boost
  your inspiration, the more stories you will create and the more stories you will
  be able to play.
  .
  Next Kickstarter campaign can finance more assets and drive them by your
  interests. Therefore most rewards are oriented with this goal with affordable
  cost.

  Marie's journal. When she picks it up, the memories come back. Because twenty
  years ago Kelsey and Marie shared this room. They spent days in it working on

  future, planning their life. Until that ghastly night. When it was all shattered
  to pieces.

  pick up objects. Learn what Kelsey remembers, read what Marie thought about it.
  As you puzzle the pieces together, you uncover the secrets of their friendship.

  "She asked me why I was so angry all the time. And I told her -- because it's a
  dirty deal. It's Russian roulette and utterly unfair. The cards I'd been dealt,
  any player would have passed. I chose to be angry instead. But Marie, my friend
  Marie, she got me a new deck. And suggested that I deal again." - Kelsey

genre: Puzzle
description:
  Maze Of Bears is a wrapping grid-based puzzle game in which to find your lost
  cats, you must evade bears, bulls, spiders, wolves, lasers , land mines, fire,
  ice, pits, and bear traps. To solve each of the 150 levels you'll learn how to
  push, pull, rubiks-slide, defuse, mirror-bounce, stealth, heat, freeze, climb,
  dig, teleport, tornado, clone and sneak.
  .
  Every level has a new idea. Starting simply, you'll soon learn how to use each
  of the 16 different bonus powers to manipulate the interactions between the 30
  different types of block. Things slowly get very complicated, especially given
  that every level wraps the top and bottom, left and right of the screen.
  Fortunately the hint system spells out how to complete every level, so you won't
  get stuck.
  .
  Add to that a simple to use Level Editor, and a customisable Random Level
  Generator, so there's that...
  .
  PC demo has 36 levels available. Feedback would be massively appreciated.
  .
  If you like the demo and want try the rest of the 150 levels you can purchase
  the full version.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  .
  When you put a onigiri in your mouth, you can change your state of being.
  .
  It will lead you to the Cat Statue, a power spot at the end of each stage, which
  is a bit of a challenge. This is a jump action game.
  .
  If you put a onigiri in your mouth, you will go to the "Onigiri state".
  .
  By chewing and swallowing the rice ball in your mouth, you can change to
  "Normal" mode.
  .
  In Normal Mode, you can turn everyone into a rice ball by firing a shot, but the
  .
  You cannot fire a shot while in Onigiri state.
  .
  Also, in the "normal" state, you can't touch "everyone" which would be a miss.
  .
  In the "Onigiri State" you can be friendly and touch each other without making a
  mistake.
  .
  It's important in this game world to switch between these two different states,
  depending on the situation .
  .
  What is the purpose of the "I" who moves on despite enduring the pain over and
  over again?
  .
  What is the true meaning of the message "Cat" tells us?
  .
  The answer may lie beyond the (true) ending.

description:
  Meeting in the Flesh is a free horror/romance visual novel. You play as Vil, the
  resident of a strange but friendly little city, encountering various people and
  getting the chance to court one of three different monstrous suitors. Though the
  game will include some body horror imagery, the game is a romance at its core,
  with a focus on getting to know and growing closer to your partner. It features
  romantic scenes that can be toggled between a PG-13 and R rating.
  .
  The world of Meeting in the Flesh is full of interesting faces, but Vil is
  pretty close to three in particular ...
  .
  Yiestol is the community overlook. Kind and gentle and takes great pride in his
  work. He cares deeply about others.
  .
  Brattan is a salt scout. Very friendly and outgoing. He loves adventure and
  excitement, and wants to discover something big!
  .
  Nyargh is the owner of a bee shop. Though gruff and stoic, he's in no way mean.
  However, he's surrounded by some odd rumors ... ?
  .
  ==========================================
  .
  Meeting in the Flesh is available for absolutely free! A small 'Thank You
  Booklet' is available to anyone who donates $2.00 or more, as a show of our
  appreciation. It contains a small collection of rough sketches, progress shots,
  and unused versions of artwork from the game.
  .
  (For anyone who previously donated that amount or more to the project while it
  was in production, please email us at inkethic@gmail.com, and we would be more
  than happy to send you the booklet as a belated thank you!)
  .
  Please report any bugs, typos, visual aberrations or error codes to us, and
  we'll fix them as soon as possible! We post game updates at inkethic at Twitter!

genre: Miscellaneous;Music
description:
  Memoir En Code: Reissue is an autobiographical game album. Designed to be
  experienced similarly to a music album, this short experimental game explores
  different bits of the author's life.
  .
  Divided in different interactive tracks, the game leads the player through the
  exploration of very personal moments, from the struggle of keeping together a
  long-distance relationship to the exploration of childhood memories.
  .
  Memoir En Code: Reissue was designed, developed and produced by only one person
  in the attempt to explore autobiography in games.
  .
  Features
  .
  9 interactive tracks with unique gameplay and mood
  .
  Sad moments and happy moments
  .
  All new graphics, sounds and user interface
  .
  9 keys to obtain

  Play multiple times to fully experience the game. ~40 minutes for a first
  playthrough, to be extended in order to reach the game's end.

  .
  F.A.Q.
  .
  How does Reissue differ from the original Memoir En Code released in 2015?
  .
  The game features all new graphics, interface, and parts of it have been re-
  designed. Reissue also includes a new final track to give closure to the game,
  plus the dev commentary. Take it as a sort of HD Remaster Extended Director's
  Cut edition.
  .
  Should I buy this game?
  .
  If you like experimental games, yes.
  .
  If you don't like experimental games, maybe.
  .
  If you give more value to content than length, yes.
  .
  If you give more value to length than content, no.
  .
  Can I put a Let's Play video on YouTube?
  .
  Yes BUT, considering that the game is fairly short, I'd appreciate if you could
  at least avoid recording the new (last) track called Lei Disse as well as the
  solution of Memoir De Code.

description:
  Mendel is a science creativity sandbox. Pilot a probe on a far away planet,
  gathering samples from the weird native flowers and breeding them together to
  make new hybrids. Watch their genes merge and mutate, just like those of our own
  world, producing strange new creations to grow in your alien gardens.
  .
  Grow your own Proteus. No goals. No objectives. No pressure. Just a peaceful
  sandbox in which to experiment, create, and relax.
  .
  Tens of thousands of possible surreal plants.
  .
  Watch your plants change and mutate as their genes combine and rearrange, just
  like those or our own world.
  .
  Inspired by science! Mendel is the first game to receive the Alfred P Sloan
  Foundation Public Understanding prize, because they recognized a commitment to
  showing how beautiful the world of genetics is.

  "It was kind of like bubble wrap. You really get into it and can't stop planting
  and trying to make them do things."

  I reread this poem recently and it inspired a game.
  .
  The intended experience is for two players to play on one keyboard.  If you
  touch hands it's okay, good fences make good neighbors.  You can also play by
  yourself.
  .
  Move along the wall and patch it up.  Once a rock is gone, it's gone.  Nature's
  first green is gold, ya know?
  .
  The demo is 1 year long; the full version goes until you lose.  I imagine 100%
  of the money I make on this game will go toward buying baby formula, so consider
  that before supporting.
  .
  Feel free to share your highscore and experience!  This was originally supposed
  to be a chill experience but I couldn't help myself, I added a score :\

genre: Adventure;Interactive Fiction;Visual Novel
description:
  Surrealist point-and-click adventure game with some word play, a whole lot of
  escapism, a dab of humor, and a dollop of existential dread.
  .
  The idea for the story came from constantly dreaming about being stuck in small
  indoor spaces and looking for nature. Likely a reflection of living in
  quarantine.
  .
  While not the first creation in The Abandoned universe, this is the first
  released creation. We currently have a Graphic Novel in the works as well as a
  larger game. Join us at https://aesth.games/ for updates on those endeavors.
  .
  --------------------------
  .
  Update 2021-02-14: Added the OST for sale.
  .
  Update 2021-02-01: Official release!
  .
  Update 2020-12-01: Made several improvements to the text, as well as QoL changes
  and performance fixes. Added official music.

  How do you see the world when nothing is real?
  .
  Each character was assigned to give a statement to be posted on this store page.
  Their responses are below:
  .
  CHRIS: Hello! I'm so excited that you're considering playing our game! I'll tell
  you as much as I can. So we're actually not the full game. We're the demo! No
  one knows if the real game is out yet or not, or what genre we're really
  supposed to be....it's kind of confusing. But that's just fine, I guess! Anyway,
  I suppose it's already been determined where you'll be going and what kinds of
  things you might be doing? I hope I get to actually meet you later. I've really
  been looking forward to it! Have a nice day!
  .
  HOPE: hey if u get any choices that lead u to a mochi store go there thats where
  the cool ppl in the game r if you dont youll probably lose ok bye
  .
  ASPEN: Hey YOU! Yeah, YOU! Wanna chat it up with some cute girls? (And a super
  cute non-binary person?) Then you've definitely found the right game! We're not
  like those other inferior dating simulators. We have the advantage of knowing
  who, how, why, and what we truly are! Well, uh...mostly. That's where you come
  in! You can be the one to tell us once and for all what we're really doing here!
  And with the help of your good buddy Aspen, we'll ensure that this game gets its
  best ending! Our fate rests upon your shoulders, O wise player!
  .
  NARI: [Declined to give a statement.]
  .
  ISADORA: WHAT?!??! MY QUOTE IS GOING TO BE LAST????? THAT'S NO FAIR!!! YOU
  SHOULD CHANGE IT SO THAT I'M, LIKE, AT LEAST SECOND? OR THIRD?!?!!? LAST IS SO
  STUPID!!!!!! NARI DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING AND SHE'S NOT EVEN LAST!!!!!
  UUUUUGGGGGGGGGGG (...wait so what exactly should I say then? ...oh, ok.) Hi! I'm
  Isadora, and...uh... (Oh, whatever, this is so stupid! Was that enough? Can I go
  now?)

genre: Puzzle;Adventure
description:
  This is a tribute to two of my favorite games of my childhood called Boulder
  Dash (C-64) and Metroid (NES).
  .
  In the middle 1980's I was a kid of seven or eight years. My uncle had got a
  brand new commodore 64 computer and my younger brother and I used to play all
  the exciting games of that times. For me at this time, the world was full of
  monsters dungeons and dragons hiding in the shadows. It was a fantastic time and
  I remember myself fighting through all this particularly hard games lost in the
  8-Bit worlds that turned into real adventures.
  .
  Micro Dash is Boulder Dash like game but with a lot of new elements and
  metroidvania features like tiny story-line, power-ups and a lot of secrets and
  hidden caves. The graphics and sound is close to the one from the original C-64
  Boulder Dash from 1986. Also the game-play is similar to the original. The
  player controls Nano, who must dig through caves collecting gems and diamonds
  and reach the exit, while avoiding various types of dangerous creatures as well
  as falling rocks or get killed by an underground explosion.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Up to four game save slots. Players can use different game slots to play
  together by player-rotation
  .
  Six worlds with about 10 to 20 caves per world to eke out plus bonus world
  .
  Up to six power-ups. Each power-up gives you a unique ability
  .
  Secrets and hidden rooms that are waiting to be found
  .
  A lot of new elements like Emeralds, Ghosts and Spiders, Keys, Doors and
  Portals, Laval, Slime and more
  .
  Up to six different color themes and six different extra cave themes
  .
  Multiple goals such like:
  .
  Solve all caves
  .
  find all power-ups
  .
  find THE lost diamond
  .
  find all secrets and opals and unlock the bonus world
  .
  make a high score

  the exit through 51 challenging levels - and 12 bonus levels - featuring a
  variety of distinctive soundscapes. Your solutions create the music.
  .
  Award Winning Design
  .
  Micron began as a game created for Kongregate's 'Project Eden: Experience the
  Music' game contest, in which it won 2nd place. The judges included Tetsuya
  Mizuguchi, creator of REZ and LUMINES, and representatives from Ubisoft,
  Gamespot, and Kongregate.
  .
  "Classic visual like the Famicon but experiencing the process of sound effects
  evolving into the music felt really good. The harder the game, the more exciting
  the music gets-this was blended perfectly." - Tetsuya Mizuguchi

game: Midnight Manor (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/M/Midnight Manor (USA)/Midnight Manor (USA).json
developer: travm
publisher: travm
genre: Platformer
description:
  Midnight Manor is a short, spooky pick-em-up platformer inspired by games like
  Bible Adventures, Super Mario Bros 2, and Lakeview Cabin Collection.
  .
  It follows the story of a man down on his luck, who happens to find himself at
  the doorstep of a luxurious manor as a terrible storm surges outside. Greeted by
  a generous, but lonely, old man - he's offered shelter in exchange for
  completing some simple tasks during his stay.
  .
  So... enter the Midnight Manor. Explore its winding hallways. Fulfill your piece
  of the bargain, and enjoy a night of luxury sheltered from the churning storm
  outside.
  .
  How To Play
  .
  You will have several tools at your disposal to traverse the manor to complete
  each task. These actions are as follows:
  .
  Action Controls (Dual Shock / Xbox / Keyboard)
  .
  Jump Cross / A / Spacebar
  .
  Drop Through Platform Holding Down + Cross / A / Spacebar
  .
  Pickup / Throw Item Square / X / E
  .
  Release Item Holding Down + Square / X /E or Triangle / Y / Q
  .
  Dash (When Unlocked) RB / Shift
  .
  Fullscreen Toggle Alt + Enter
  .
  Note: Keyboard controls have been provided, but it is highly recommended that
  you play with a controller for the best possible experience.
  .
  Multiple Endings
  .
  The game has been designed as a short experience that must be completed in a
  single sitting. Multiple endings are provided to encourage curiosity and
  replayability. There are FOUR endings to complete. Weigh your options and choose
  wisely.
  .
  Speedruns Encouraged
  .
  Each playthrough is timed to encourage speedrunning. Your in-game time will be
  displayed at the end of the game and your best times for each ending will be
  saved in-game.
  .
  Powerful Secrets
  .
  The manor has its fair share of secrets. Some of these can help you along the
  way. Keep an eye out for shortcuts and pickups that may grant you additional
  speed and abilities.
  .
  Forge Your Own Path
  .
  There is no predetermined path outside of completing the tasks assigned to you.
  The game is designed to be short and re-playable. Some routes are better than
  others and the game encourages you to complete multiple playthroughs to find the
  quickest and most efficient path to complete your goals.
  .
  Special Thanks
  .
  I wanted to include a special thank you to Vincent Soud whose enthusiasm and
  support for this project has helped improve the game and guide future
  development. He has pushed the game to its limits and offered many suggestions
  that have helped make the game what it is today.

description:
  The Missing Locksmith is an alternate reality game that sees you use real world
  tools to delve through the lives of three thieves.
  .
  After a heist goes wrong, the crew can't trust anyone - even each other. So,
  they set up a safe that needs one digit from each of them, to make sure no-one
  disappears with the haul.
  .
  Can you crack their combination?
  .
  Starting with the clues you've been sent, you'll need to solve codes, send
  emails, decipher voice notes, and hack websites to find the information you
  need.
  .
  Be careful, though - you're not the only one who wants it...
  .
  FAQ
  .
  Do I need to have played an ARG before?
  .
  This is a short online experience that doesn't require knowledge of the ARG
  genre.
  .
  Do I need anything to play?
  .
  Just the downloaded files, a web browser, and an email account.
  .
  How many people can play?
  .
  This can be played through solo, or as an escape room-style game for a group. To
  play with more than one person, distribute the starting clues between players
  (without looking at them), and go from there!
  .
  Who created this game?
  .
  The Missing Locksmith was created by Elle Osili-Wood as an online Easter egg
  hunt during the 2020 lockdown. That'll make sense when you play it.

  I love precision platformers, but they've always been really difficult. Mobility
  is my attempt to make the genre more accessible, with different difficulty
  settings, accessibility options, and a browser version. (Die-hard fans, though,
  can also ignore all that and just play everything on the highest difficulty.
  Your choice!)
  .
  In Mobility, every platform is a switch you activate upon contact. The goal in
  each level is to activate all platforms, making each level a little puzzle,
  especially when you're attempting to score a new record. In the story, these
  rooms are engine rooms on spaceships that you (a repairman in training) has to
  fix.
  .
  I made this game over two years, in my free time during my game design study.
  While I am not charging for this game, if you enjoy it consider voting with your
  wallet to support me with making more games in the future.

description:
  Mole is a fun game for anyone to enjoy. It is based on the classic whack-a-mole
  game style so it is very intuitive and easy to understand, but it will keep you
  playing for hours while trying to beat your own record! Or maybe your friends'
  records!
  .
  There are three gameplay styles:
  .
  The first one is the King style, where you have a limited amount of moles to
  hit, but you may want to be quick, because as time goes by the moles start
  popping more and more often!
  .
  The second style would be the Lover style. The Lover mole is a mole who loves
  hearts and he'll do anything to get one, and every time you forget to hit a
  mole, a heart will pop up, so if you don't stop him, he will get it for him and
  you will lose one of yours! Try not to lose all three!
  .
  The third style would be the Devil! You are on a deadline and every time you
  don't hit a mole you'll have even less time to play! So be fast and don't let
  any mole get away so that you can play as long you can!

developer: Xexus
publisher: Xexus
genre: Card Game;Puzzle
description:
  MonGirl Tile is a card game where you face off against various cute monster
  girls on a 55 grid. Each player has three tiles in a hand and takes turns
  placing them, capturing other adjacent tiles based on the tile's facing value.
  Not only are the values of your tiles important but also their position on the
  game board. The goal is to capture your opponent's tiles and control the
  majority of the board when all spaces are filled.
  .
  - Easy to Learn, Hard to Master: When a tile is captured it rotates, changing
  which numbers are facing which side. In this way you can try to block or
  manipulate your opponent's moves.
  .
  - Cascading Captures: Enemy tiles adjacent to your captured tiles can also be
  captured, continuing on and on. Place your tile wisely and watch as you flip
  half your enemy's tiles!
  .
  - Elemental Attributes: Some tiles have elemental gems that alter the values of
  enemy tiles around them. There are five elements and learning to use them could
  be the key to victory!
  .
  NOTE: We have received complaints that the Mac version is not running.  I have
  removed the Mac file as neither me nor the programmer still have a mac and can
  not fix or confirm the file.  I apologize for the inconvenience and will re-
  upload if/when we find a solution.

  NOW AVAILABLE ON: Android, Windows, and MacOS.
  .
  monad is meant to be experienced in a dark, quiet room, on a large screen with a
  surround-sound system or headphones, and with a multi-touch screen for input.
  .
  monad was initially conceived as an experiment with space, wherein at the very
  moment that the player engaged with the system, a white circle began to grow,
  unrestrained, until it occupied the entire screen, the entire space.  Leaving no
  room for agency.
  .
  The black circle came about as a means for the player to regain space.  The
  soundscape came about in order to give more dimension to the feelings that the
  visuals were already evoking.
  .
  monad is made with LVE, with help and support from that community as well as
  Louisville Makes Games.
  .
  monad has been exhibited at:

genre: Puzzle;Action
description:
  In this fast-paced, action puzzle game, you will need to defend your home
  against a band of heroes intent on ending your un-life and taking your treasure.
  .
  As heroes assault your domain, you will need to combine essence in order to
  summon monsters for defense.
  .
  Match 3 of the same type of monster on the grid to gain some essence. Acquire
  enough of the same essence to summon that monster.
  .
  Your monsters will fight against the heroes, stalling their advance and keeping
  them from reaching your inner sanctum.
  .
  Every monster type and hero has unique stats: Health, Attack, Physical Defense,
  and Special Defense, and each monster and hero will attach with either Physical
  or Special. Based on these stats, your monsters will fair better against some
  heroes than others.
  .
  Your realm contains 7 locations, each with it's own, unique monsters. When a
  hero is left unopposed by your forces, it will gradually, but steadily advance
  through the current location.
  .
  When the hero reaches the end of a location and moves on to the next one, your
  leftover essence will be used to construct a temporary, magical barrier, which
  will block the heroes from advancing for a short time.

  BE WARNED: This is no real learning software. If you want a professional guide

  Story
  .
  Moonstone is a pretty mountain village that owes its riches to a famous mine,
  that has recently become a source of major trouble for the inhabitants. Since
  part of it caved in due to a mysterious explosion, the village is haunted at
  night by dangerous creatures that have already caused one casualty: Terence the
  Baker.  With your companions, you decide to help the villagers (for a handsome
  reward of course as nobody works for free nowadays) to get rid of said monsters.
  What starts as a simple "cleaning operation" of the mines quickly evolves into
  an epic drama about lost civilizations, historic guilt, race disputes, and
  difficult choices about loyalty, justice, and trust. And yes, there is also a
  love story or two, depending on your choices.
  .
  What can you do in this game?
  .
  In 7 hours of gameplay you can enjoy interesting tales, play detective and solve
  a hideous crime, fight deadly enemies, solve intriguing puzzles, play minigames,
  win/lose your money at gambling, loot chests, trade, open a bank account, open
  doors with picklocks.  Make tough choices with not always foreseeable
  consequences.
  .
  How will it end?
  .
  This depends entirely on your choices. There are three possible ends:  happy
  end,  bad end, and death.  Death means "game over" - you won't even have the
  doubtful pleasure of seeing the bad end ...

  Reviews
  .
  "One Of 2017's Best Games... It elicits dark feelings, but asks players to
  consider where those feelings came from and what makes them dark."
  .
  - Kotaku
  .
  One Of Polygon's Best Games of 2017 - "The video game industry is built on the
  destruction of bodies of all kinds. How refreshing to play a game that asks you
  to care for them, even after their life has left."
  .
  - Polygon
  .
  "82/100 - An approachable and thought-provoking meditation on life's only
  certainty."

  - PC Gamer
  .
  "Recommended - This is a beautiful game. It scared me. It moved me. Most of all,
  it made me stop what I was doing and think."
  .
  - EuroGamer
  .
  "8/10 - [A Mortician's Tale] is a short game, only an hour or so long, but it
  leaves an impact far beyond its runtime. Give it a chance, and it might just
  change the way you think about death."

game: My Haunted Doll (USA)

developer: AMAXANG GAMES
publisher: AMAXANG GAMES
genre: Adventure
description:
  My Haunted Doll is a 2D Survival Horror game based on the story of the cursed
  doll of the 1800s which is said to be possessed by the spirits of the little
  girl and the Devil.
  .
  Mary, the owner of the Mary Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques,
  clothes, dolls, bones and utensils. Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique
  store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her
  museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll.
  She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the
  paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the
  things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while
  she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she
  started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced,
  poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she
  started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was
  cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she
  came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid
  of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was
  originally kept and the curse would be lifted.
  .
  However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will
  try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse,
  placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  Explore the Museum for the proof of the paranormal.
  .
  Demons are lurking in the shadows.
  .
  Experience the poltergeist activities and nightmarish illusions.
  .
  Face your fears while exploring the building and unknown locations.
  .
  Nearly half an hour duration of the paranormal investigation.
  .
  Note from developer: I am a solo indie game developer and I have created all of
  the graphics, artwork, animation, character design and programming myself.

genre: Action;Puzzle
description:
  (NOTE: This was included in the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality! There's
  no need to purchase it here if you've already got it there!)
  .
  Nano Driller is a bite-sized puzzle-action adventure that can be beaten in 25-45
  minutes. With an alternative ship type, a unique difficulty option, and swift,
  racing-style controls, this game is perfect for replaying whenever you feel
  like.
  .
  This game is a sort of follow-up to Cell Driller, a game I made a couple years
  back for a jam focused around one-button games. Nano Driller was made due to my
  desire to experiment with what this unique control scheme would be like if it
  were adopted to a more palatable form. To supplement this, the game also
  features its own, quirky take on the usual lock-and-key exploration design,
  making the most out of the fairly small level structure. Give it a try!

  About this game
  .
  In a grasp for salvation with sentinels closing in, you've stolen a Nauticrawl.
  You check the radar, turn a few knobs, press some buttons... then you realize
  .
  I don't know how to move this hunk of metal...
  .
  If the pursuing forces or the crushing atmosphere don't kill you first, the
  Nauticrawl - designed to be piloted only by the ruling elites - just might. This
  instrument, your only hope of survival, could also be your demise.
  .
  With the right amount of experimentation your escape plan just might succeed.
  Pull levers, redirect power, hack devices, uncover communications, try anything
  and everything.
  .
  You've heard the rumors. You know many have died doing what you're doing. But as
  the corners of the story pull back and you learn your way around the consoles,
  you just might get off this wretched rock.
  .
  Nauticrawl unfolds through turn-based exploration, as you puzzle out how
  everything fits together. Begin each run anew, but bring with you what you've
  learned along the way.
  .
  Think it through. Make mistakes and experiment.
  .
  You can do this.

  Ruin everything.
  .
  You are a banker. You want to extract as much wealth from the world as possible
  --or, at least, more than everyone else. You will manipulate the global economy
  in order to siphon money into your secret Swiss bank account. Whoever has the
  most Swiss money in 12 turns wins the game.
  .
  Play solo against the AI or multiplayer against people who will imminently cease
  to be your friends.
  .
  Buy votes.
  .
  Unlike most strategy games, you will never have access to armies and never
  directly control territory. Instead, you will spread your influence throughout
  the globe by purchasing votes in parliament, or selling your votes to incite a
  military coup. You always share power with your rivals, waiting for the moment
  when you can backstab them.
  .
  Make free trade agreements.
  .
  Re-route industrial wealth throughout the world, from Mines to Factories via
  exploitative trade agreements. Remember: your goal is to make a profit, NOT to
  improve the world.
  .
  Manipulate the IMF.
  .
  Control the International Monetary Fund to force policy decisions without a
  regional parliament's approval. Basically, screw over your opponents without
  them being able to do a thing about it.

  .
  The government has won the cyber war. Their grasp chokes the citizens of every
  country as oppression rules the world. Then a group of hackers carved out an
  untraceable piece of cyberspace and created the underground network known as
  Neon Valley. Since then, it has become a place where both the good and the bad
  coexist as the last of the free. And such places always attract a need for
  entertainment, thus the Neon Valley Colosseum was born.
  .
  An online shooter inspired by retrowave and neo-80s. Neon Valley takes an
  arcade-like route to the shooter genre. With high score leaderboards based on
  both skill and style. Fast-paced combat akin to Quake and Unreal Tournament.
  Game modes such as floor is lava, obstacle courses and more. Neon Valley is a
  place where the best come to attain infamy and carve out their name in the
  cyberspace.
  .
  The new frontier Neon Valley. A place free from the grips of the government, a
  place where humanity indulges. This is where black market trades are done, where
  secrets are shared and ideas, outlawed by the government, discussed. A world
  where the good and the bad coexist as the last of the free.
  .
  At the core of Neon Valley, the Colosseum exists. On the surface, it thrives as
  an entertainment complex. As challenges for skill junkies. As a platform to
  notoriety. But the Colosseum fuels this virtual world. It draws in new
  challengers all over the world and with this comes opportunity. The black market
  programmers use it to test virtual weapons. Dealers barter and wager on the
  outcome of battles. Designers display their latest fashion code. Map editors
  design intricate battlegrounds. At the center lies you. The user. Will you show
  the world what you've got?
  .
  This is a place of entertainment where most come to conquer the battlegrounds.
  To prove their skills above all others in the new frontier and obtain infamy.
  For some of our ambitions never fade through the ages. However, behind the
  Colosseum and the city is a network of shadows who control its affairs. Some
  support the rebellion from the shadows... Others profit off the market and guide
  its very design. Their whims might be in your benefit.
  .
  Battle suit
  .
  Here users compete with Battle Suits. A program interface which a user takes
  control of, giving them freedom of movement and an assortment of items. Items
  which they take onto the field for offensive and defensive purposes. Users
  battle to unlock new gear, increasing their prowess on the battlegrounds,
  climbing to reach the top of the leaderboards.
  .
  Movement
  .
  Your suit has full range of motion using "WASD" inputs. Each suit has the
  ability of partial air control, adjusting your trajectory mid-air. This also
  includes sprinting state activated with "Shift". Crouching state with "C" input,
  for taking cover behind low objects and a smaller attack profile. Eventually for
  better shooting accuracy and going under obstacles too. Also, stealth option
  with the newly added foliage. It's also the state you enter after performing a
  slide maneuver.
  .
  Sliding
  .
  Talking about slide maneuver, sliding is patched in. Activating crouch whilst in
  motion will perform a slide. While sprinting the battle suit does a short dash,
  followed by an extended slide. Sliding in air, it slightly increases user down
  velocity, to mimic a shinobi air dash move inspired by ninjas.
  .
  Dashing
  .
  Expending stamina/energy to dash allows the user to increase directional
  acceleration of the battle suit using small boosters attached to the lower back.
  This booster is used to avoid enemy attacks, dashing onto areas just out of
  reach and general evasion or positioning.
  .
  Wall Jump
  .
  Increased leg thrust power in the battle suits allow for users to wall jump.
  Covering further distance and allows for consecutive wall jumps. This is a great
  utility maneuver to reach higher ground, avoid pursuit and out play opponents.
  .
  Shields
  .
  Each battle suit has a forcefield as the first layer of defense. Take cover when
  it breaks to regenerate or risk taking damage to your health.
  .
  Stamina
  .
  Yes, stamina is simulated in this virtual world. Something to limit the freedom
  of movement and create opportunities for entertaining situations. Dashing,
  sliding, sprinting and wall jumps consume stamina. However, it will regenerate
  given some cool down time.
  .
  Character customization
  .
  Added a range of items for character customization, more are in the works! They
  are rewards for gladiators who participate and awe the spectators in combat.
  Inside the Colosseum
  .
  or the arena. Find the orange card, in a club for champions.
  .
  Camera controls
  .
  Each battle suit is fitted with a small drone camera to provide a wider
  perspective for better spatial awareness. You can activate toggle this camera
  with Q. Your visor and drone camera are designed with adaptive magnification
  built in. Allowing the user to freely zoom with or without weapons fitted with
  scopes.
  .
  Shoulder switch
  .
  Use "Z" to switch shoulders in 3rd person. This will move the default shoulder
  position of the drone camera to the other shoulder. Useful in peeking around
  corners, better bullet trajectory for tight angles and also for user preference.
  .
  Alt
  .
  Hold "Alt" to look around with the camera. In 3rd person this will rotate the
  camera around the user. Basically, allowing the user to easily surveil their
  surroundings or to check themselves out.
  .
  Relay cam
  .
  When shot, your drone camera deactivates. This switches off the drone camera and
  reactivates first person view. Pay attention to drone cams peeking around
  corners, deactivate them and restrict the surveillance utility of your enemies.
  .
  Combat
  .
  Users have numerous weapons at their disposal, from pistols to rifles, lasers or
  ricochet bullets. Numerous gadgets are available too, from gravity modifiers to
  teleportation tools. Abilities that create shields or grapple hooks. Primary,
  secondary and Akimbo that replaces primary with a secondary. Equip in the menus
  or in The Mainframe. They are restricted by the Red multi-pass to access.
  Winning gets support from anonymous arms dealers unlocking more tools at your
  disposal. As your victories are not only your own but many of the black market
  users who bet on your wins and losses.
  .
  Dual wield
  .
  The largest change to guns. Secondary weapons can now be equipped dual wield.
  Even though it replaces the primary weapon slot, the idea is that a dual wielded
  weapon has the same power and perhaps more versatility than a primary weapon.
  Giving users this option is part of the game design philosophy of allowing users
  to fully customize their gear according to a playstyle they wish.
  .
  Melee weapon - Primary weapon sub-class
  .
  Added the slide for a reason. To increase the ninja-like game feel, the long
  awaited Ninjato sword has been added. The first of the melee weapons. Still
  working out fluidity kinks, motion and better collision detection.
  .
  Ninjato has a 4 attack types:
  .
  High & low
  .
  High attacks, using Left Mouse input, the user dashes towards looking direction
  and this attack has 3 moves in its combo. Low attacks uses the Right Mouse input
  and the user performs a slide motion whilst slashing in a 3 move combo too.
  .
  High and Low attacks can be interchanged to perform different combos. For
  example, R + L + R will perform a high, low, high attack chain. Attacks have a
  movement multiplier according to movement input. Holding forward, attacks lunge
  further as gap closers to reach gun users. When holding backwards, attacks are
  performed on the spot.
  .
  Jump
  .
  The jump attack gives the user a double jump, essentially. At the apex of the
  double jump the user attacks, reaching targets with the height advantage.
  .
  Slide
  .
  While in sliding motion there is a small window to attack, which triggers a
  slide attack. Shortly dashing the user forward whilst simultaneously slicing
  vertically, the user can quickly reach an enemy and damages everything along the
  dashing path.
  .
  Gadgets
  .
  Each gadget has a certain utility and mostly defense oriented. Designed by the
  River dragon these tools are locked behind the blue multipass. Various shields
  for defense, or get creative and use them as platforms. A pulse clear which
  absorbs all incoming bullets akin to bullet hell games. Lastly, a gravity
  multiplier which grounds any object in its range and stuns enemies. Apply these
  limited ammo items in the right situation to triumph.
  .
  Nades - Gadget sub-class
  .
  There are four grenades in the users arsenal. Vision distortion, teleportation,
  explosive and a force push sticky nade. Each has their own advantages.
  .
  Movement gadget - Gadget sub-class
  .
  Rapid terrain traversal gadgets, which are perfect for repositioning and moving
  over obstacles. A booster pack which propels the user where they are aiming,
  designed to be the most agile of the movement gadgets. The grapple hook moves
  the user the furthest but at the cost of telegraphing their movements. Lastly,
  the newly added boost pad. A gadget which can be used offensively as well,
  setting a trap for enemies and launching them away from you... Or into a
  vulnerable position.
  .
  Maps
  .
  Many battlegrounds are available and each provides their own environmental
  challenges. Designed to cater to certain playstyles while testing others.
  Ranging from close quarters to large monolithic structures perfect for vertical
  gameplay. Numerous new battleground designs are continually being developed, and
  with successive firmware updates, they will become available.
  .
  Taiyo
  .
  A map designed after a Japanese village. Once a trading forum this cyberspace
  has a village center, tight alleyways and buildings with breakable walls.
  Surrounded by forests with dense foliage for stealth. Terrain has heightened
  waterfall for an overview of the village and obscured pathways.
  .
  Cube
  .
  The designated training map for gladiators. The blocks are orderly placed to
  practice ricochet shots and wall jumps. It provides a balanced battle map and
  segmented into optimal areas for each weapon class. Cube has patrol drones that
  provide training against the corporations offensive systems. They are designed
  with sturdier defenses for increased challenge.
  .
  Monolith
  .
  A mysterious monolith has crashed into the center of this map. It has
  interesting gravitational properties which dynamically change the map when the
  trigger is activated. This map favors long range combat with the long cracks
  into the terrain made by the impact.
  .
  Modes
  .
  Invader
  .
  Obviously inspired by invaders, this mode challenges the user with an onslaught
  of various attack drones. Each armed with unique functions to hinder or deal
  damage.  They spawn above the colosseum in waves, tracking down their target.
  .
  Lava
  .
  The terrain turns into lava on selected maps. Firewall inspired lava rises,
  slowly consuming the map and increases difficulty traversing the map in floor is
  lava mode. With a rising lava tide you must reach the counter hack objective.
  This will push back the fire wall lava and give you back valuable ground. Hold
  the points against spawning fireballs, more users in the zone the more points
  awarded... However, more fireballs will spawn. When making contact with lava the
  user will be shot up, like the classics.
  .
  Scoring when reaching a point with the following multipliers: on survival time,
  wall jump count and time spent not touching the ground. Bonus points on up to 3
  other users who also reach the point, motivating cooperation. More users on the
  point increases hacking speed.
  .
  Data
  .
  This mode is designed after search and destroy... Sort of. Disable the virus
  before it infects your code, bring it to the quarantine zone to dispose of it.
  But from the cyberspace breach, where the virus entered from, debris are
  crashing in and falling across the map. Avoid getting crushed while avoiding
  opposing players who might be after the prize.
  .
  Reach the designated quarantine zone and get points. The quarantine zone,
  according to a timer to avoid viral countermeasures, reaching one of these zones
  within 15 seconds of it spawning with a virus will give a large multiplier.
  Avoid obstacles, falling debris from the breach and other players hunting you
  down. On death the virus will detach and begin finding a new target.
  .
  Multipass system
  .
  Completing objectives, and reaching the required points will reward the user
  with a multipass. According to the favor of the dragons whom benefit from these
  matches. Keep an eye out for anonymous rewards from hidden backers each with a
  stake in your success.
  .
  Scoring
  .
  Scoring is done on objective completions or kills... However, there are
  multipliers designed to reward stylish gameplay. Ricochet kills, gadget
  combination, consecutive wall jumps, survival count and more.
  .
  Enemy NPC
  .
  Attack drone: Fastest of the drones, they shoot tiny high speed projectiles. As
  they are hard to see, stay in motion to avoid damage! When they reach a certain
  distance from the player they will begin orbiting while shooting. Make sure to
  not get surrounded.
  .
  Roll drone: These drones move about covertly, they roll along the ground hidden
  amongst foliage and crevices. When in range of their target a tractor beam is
  activated which keeps its object in place for the attack drones to finish the
  job. Their beams can be countered if you manage to reach its edge and resist its
  gravity.
  .
  Laser drone: Visually, its most notable feature are its forward shields. Able to
  deflect most energy weapons. Keep a railgun handy to deal with them... or find a
  more creative solution. Their lazer beams do a high rate of damage per second
  however their turn speed is limited, presenting a possible weakness.
  .
  And those are only the invader drones. There are an assortment of other enemies
  each with their own behaviors, weaknesses and challenges. From a virus that
  corrupts what it touches to an electric ball that dodges bullets as it hunts
  you. Each belonging to specific challenges, however there are more yet. Patrol
  drones which spawn on the Cube map. Designed as training bots, these patrol
  drones have extra shielding but an exposed vent port on the back.
  .
  Mainframe
  .
  The city at the center of Neon Valley. Here one can find a variety of features,
  however most are locked for gladiators. For security reasons a multi access pass
  is required. Gladiators can earn these through The Gates. Challenges are
  designed as minigames, variations on main game modes plus a waypoint race, they
  are challenges to test the users ability. Training the users for the games
  ahead.  Access will unlock customization options, sampling new technologies from
  The Dragons and more. Lets just say, everyone has to earn their way in... One
  way or another.

game: Nepenthe (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/N/Nepenthe (USA)/Nepenthe (USA).json
developer: Yitz
publisher: Yitz
genre: Role Playing
description:
  You wake up with no memory. Your day is starting off great!
  .
  Nepenthe is a hand-drawn RPG with a terrible sense of humor. Set in the strange
  world of Carithia, you play as a creepy bald dude who lost his memory. Yes, you
  read that right. Meet some very polite monsters, and battle both them and your
  sense of self-dignity in epic bullet-hell fight scenes.
  .
  Definitely not a potato in a trench coat
  .
  Sporting a childish hand-drawn art style, Nepenthe is sure to either make you
  love it at first glance, or throw your computer away. The developer of Nepenthe
  takes no responsibility for such actions, and recommends drinking chamomile tea.
  "It's really soothing," he says. "You should really try it one day," he says.
  "What was I talking about?" He asks. There is an awkward pause.
  .
  designed for non-psychopaths, mostly
  .
  With three different endings, and countless side-quests, Nepenthe is designed
  for ultimate replayability. This can get quite annoying if you need to share a
  computer with someone else. Trust me. Almost every monster can be spared, for
  added challenge and less violence. They can also be killed - don't worry, you
  psychopaths! If you enjoy dad-jokes or Chinese water torture, Nepenthe is for
  you.
  .
  Be psychoanalyzed by a monster!
  .
  Nepenthe is designed for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. Explore two
  "modes," "Adventure" or "Story," to find the play-style that best suits you.
  .
  Story or Adventure?
  .
  "Adventure" mode is a bullet-hell extravaganza, with ever increasing difficulty
  as the game progresses.
  .
  Battling legislation is always hard
  .
  "Story" mode's battles are easy one-click things, designed for those who just
  want the story, not the gameplay.
  .
  Battle Ninjas! ...if you want to, of course, we're not suggesting you actually
  do it..
  .
  Join us, as we stare into the Orb together.

developer: Raw Fury
publisher: Raw Fury
genre: Simulation;Visual Novel
description:
  A mysterious serial killer stalks the streets of modern-day Paris. The body
  count rises, and the police are no closer to catching the culprit. You are a
  taxi driver and survivor to the killer's most recent attacks, having barely
  escaped with your life. You have seven nights to help find the killer, or the
  police will pin it on you. These next few shifts will be far from ordinary or
  safe...
  .
  Night Call is a non-linear, narrative-driven noire investigation game. You are
  no detective, but you do have a gift. Around you, people feel more at ease. They
  talk. They share their thoughts, their emotions, their stories... their secrets.
  To passengers, you are more than just a driver; you are also a friend, a
  confidant, a shrink. A voyeur catching a glimpse under the masked but very real
  lives throughout the City of Light. And you'll need to play these roles well if
  you want to catch the killer.
  .
  Use the limited time you have available each night to gather clues while earning
  money to pay your bills. Drive passengers to their destinations, hear their
  stories and choose your responses carefully-some are just regular people with a
  tale to tell, while others might reveal a clue that's key to your investigation.
  Follow the right leads to uncover new info about the suspects, and don't forget
  to make enough money to buy gas and pay your bills.
  .
  Can you solve the mystery before it's too late? Better hurry-both the clock and
  the meter are running...
  .
  A VIVID AND ORIGINAL CAST: Meet over 85 original, surprising, realistic
  characters and share their lives for a few brief moments. Some may move you,
  inspire you, or upset you. Listen and help - they might have something useful
  for you.
  .
  GORGEOUS GAME NOIRE STYLE: Every character and location are lovingly hand-drawn
  in stunning black & white, evoking the pure tension of the noire style of art.
  .
  INVESTIGATION VS. SURVIVAL: Will you forsake information for more money, or
  sacrifice your income to get the info you need? Make your choices quickly - time
  is running out!
  .
  MULTIPLE CASES, MULTIPLE KILLERS: Gather clues across three distinct cases. Can
  you uncover the identity of the killers? Be careful: a guilty suspect in one
  case may be completely innocent in the next.
  .
  ROAM THE STREETS: Investigating a murder is tough work. Free Roaming mode lets
  you relax and peruse the streets of Paris. Enjoy an interesting conversation or
  ten!

  ... the most genuinely realistic game ever made. It is like life: puzzling,
  difficult, uncertain, unclear, always seen, in St Paul's words, through a glass
  darkly.  - Bryan Appleyard, The Sunday Times
  .
  The Night Journey (2007-2018) is one of the first experimental art games ever
  made. A collaboration between renowned media artist Bill Viola and designers at
  the USC Game Innovation Lab, it uses both game and video techniques to tell the
  universal story of an individual's journey towards enlightenment.
  .
  After being exhibited around the world for the past decade, this foundational
  videogame artwork has now come to home platforms. Updated for this release with
  new, original dream footage, the project stands as a milestone in the search to
  expand the boundaries of what game experiences may communicate through their
  game mechanics and world design.
  .
  About the experience:
  .
  The game begins in the center of a mysterious landscape on which darkness is
  falling. There is no one path to take, no single goal to achieve, but the
  player's actions will reflect on themselves and the world, transforming and
  changing them both. If they are able, they may slow down time itself and
  forestall the fall of darkness. If not, there is always another chance; the
  darkness will bring dreams that enlighten future journeys.
  .
  The interactive design of The Night Journey evokes a sense of the archetypal
  journey of enlightenment through the mechanics of the game experience - i.e. the
  choices and actions of the player during the game. The game design explores a
  challenging question: what is the game mechanic of enlightenment? How can we
  model such an intensely personal yet archetypal experience in a game?
  .
  Visual inspiration is derived from the prior works of Bill Viola which provide
  reference for the game world, while source material for the in-game
  "reflections" is drawn from the vast archive of his video footage. Textual
  inspiration comes from the lives and writings of great historical figures
  including: Rumi, the 13th century Islamic poet and mystic; Rykan, the 18th
  century Zen Buddhist poet; St. John of the Cross, the 16th century Spanish
  mystic and poet; and Plotinus, the 3rd century philosopher.
  .
  The team created a set of custom post-processing techniques for the 3D
  environment that give a sense of "explorable video," integrating the imagery of
  Bill Viola's prior work into the game world at both a technical and creative
  level.
  .
  The Night Journey was awarded "Most Sublime Experience" at the IndieCade
  Festival of Independent Games.

description:
  Vera is the lighthouse keeper in the little island of Tempest Rock, but a storm
  is raging outside and the old building isn't strong enough to face against the
  winds and pouring rain. Help her maintain it in tip-top shape during this dark
  and fateful night to keep any ships from crashing against the rocks below!
  .
  Web and downloadable version available. The downloadable version has better
  graphic quality and performance.
  .
  HOW TO PLAY
  .
  Keep the lighthouse running until sunrise. Repair the machinery that fail and
  break down during the night.
  .
  Rain coming in from an open window can fill the room with water and shortcircuit
  the generator. Close it to stop the flooding.
  .
  The generator produces energy for the whole building and if it fails the other
  machines will stop working. Repair it to keep them powered up.
  .
  The engine rotates the lamp so ships can see it from all directions.
  .
  The lamp spreads the light from the lightbulb to guide ships. Replace a fused
  bulb with a new one when it breaks.

  Content Warnings
  .
  The full game of NINA AQUILA: LEGAL EAGLE, SEASON ONE contains some content that
  may not be considered appropriate for all ages, and in some cases may not be
  safe for work.
  .
  The game involves murder investigations, and although there is no graphic
  violence or gore, we would like to forewarn audiences who are particularly
  averse to themes of arson, murder and death by car-related incident that they
  may find its themes troubling.
  .
  There is some mild nudity, typically framed in a humorous/cute manner. Several
  images exist of a character in poses & outfits that some audiences may find
  sexy/provocative.
  .
  Further Info
  .
  Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle is a series of indie "anime courtroom drama adventure"
  games, made by solo developer Ethan Fox for Tanuki-sama Studios.
  .
  NALE was originally released on itchio as a webgame in late 2018, to initial
  success. Two additional episodic downloadable chapters were developed over the
  following years, bringing the total number of chapters to 3. These Chapters II
  and III were presented here on itch as stand-alone games.
  .
  The game's first chapter would later win a cash prize in the "Best of November
  2020" category on Newgrounds.
  .
  Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle, Season One takes the three existing chapters and rolls
  them into one game, adding many enhancements, such as improved visuals, art &
  animation, improved sound & voice samples and countless more.
  .
  This Season One release effectively replaces the older games and can be
  considered the definitive version of Nina Aquila: Legal Eagle Chapters I-III.
  Additionally, this Season One release on itchio is effectively the same game as
  the Steam release (minus achievements).

  Nonsense Soccer  is a platformer-soccer-hybrid for people who like chaotic local
  multiplayer games. At its core it's a fun little soccer game with simple
  controls for up to 4 players.  With 8 cool multiplayer arenas and a short but
  sweet target practice mode for solo players, there's already hours of fun to be
  had with, with more content to be added in the future.
  .
  Update 0.6.0 out now!
  .
  Changelist:
  .
  Menu overhaul! Menus are prettier, I think :)
  .
  New replay feature! Each goal now has a replay :)
  .
  Visual improvements here and there
  .
  Fixed: Sometimes the ball and players were stuck inside walls
  .
  Improved behaviour when running up and down slopes
  .
  This game is in an early access state and does not represent the final quality
  of the product. Expect weird bugs, things looking & behaving crazy and all the
  other fun things and some work-in-progress things that make the game not fun.
  It's highly recommended to give feedback and bug reports in the community, send
  me video links to YouTube, ping me on Twitter and all the stuff like that.

  A Normal Lost Phone is a game about exploring the intimacy of an unknown person
  whose phone was found by the player.
  .
  OUT NOW on PC, MAC, LINUX, iOS and Android!
  .
  Through the interface of a mobile phone, the player must discover what happened
  to its owner, Sam. Digging through secrets scattered among apps, text messages
  and photo galleries, the player-voyeur starts witnessing the emotions of Sam,
  and behind the apparent light-heartedness of a teenage story, their questioning
  on coming of age, homophobia, depression or the search of oneself.
  .
  Features
  .
  An immersive and intuitive way of introducing the narrative through a fake
  smartphone interface.
  .
  A game that bridges the gap between reality and fiction by letting players act
  as themselves. The game asks a simple question: if you close the app but still
  think about the game, have you truly stopped playing?
  .
  A relatable story that helps build empathy with the characters, allowing to
  explore difficult topics such as identity, gender binarism, individuation and
  privacy.
  .
  "It shares some of the feeling of Her Story, albeit featuring today's technology
  and with less of a focus on the crime angle. But it has the same small moments
  of revelation, all of which come together to form a story in its own neat yet
  meandering way."
  .
  Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  "This new phone has a lot to explore, even if you may not see it on the first
  look. It's a clever way of delivering a narrative, with you discovering more
  about Sam, the more you investigate the phone. Will you find out what happened
  to Sam?"

developer: Orthogonal Games
publisher: Orthogonal Games
genre: Adventure
description:
  The Novelist asks one central question: can you achieve your dreams without
  pushing away the people you love? The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist
  struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the
  best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal
  home for the summer, unaware that they're sharing the house with a mysterious
  ghostly presence: you.
  .
  Read the family's thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and
  intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can't help the Kaplans if
  they know there's a ghost in the house. It's up to you to decide how Dan's
  career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy
  answers, and every choice has a cost.
  .
  Dan's relationships - to his work, his wife, and his son - react and shift in
  response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every
  playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play
  .
  The decisions you make will define the Kaplans' lives, but they may also tell
  you something about yourself.
  .

  (This is the original free student project. The fully complete Octodad: Dadliest
  Catch can be purchased here.)
  .
  Octodad is a third person adventure game about destruction, deception, and
  fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a
  human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle,
  as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while
  simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.
  .
  The player controls Octodad like a marionette, dragging his arms and legs around
  while his body flops along. The player's goals are often simple household chores
  made difficult and interesting by the flailing, tenuous control they have over
  Octodad's body.
  .
  Being an octopus also has its strengths. Octodad can slip through tight spaces,
  grab objects with his suckers, and knock things around with tremendous strength.
  But if the player does things too out-of-the-ordinary, Octodad's family will
  grow suspicious and realize what he really is. If they do, it's game over for
  Octodad!

  Um zodíaco extraordinário atravessa o firmamento da Vila Itororó.
  .
  Em 2011, após anos de disputa, o governo de São Paulo removeu as últimas
  famílias do lugar. A Vila havia sido expropriada para se tornar um centro
  cultural. Ficaram as estátuas de cimento e as construções de arquitetura
  exótica, vazias de gente, na condição de patrimônio tombado.
  .
  Mas ainda paira sobre a Vila uma impressão de eventos que não cabem nesse
  acervo. Os objetos de memória dos antigos moradores contam outras histórias.
  Antigas Constelações evoca esse universo a partir de depoimentos e réplicas
  digitais, reanimados numa experiência de realidade virtual pelos céus acima
  da instituição.

  .
  Este documentário executável faz parte de uma pesquisa sobre interfaces
  críticas com nosso patrimônio material. Aqui, está em questão o papel dos
  processos de mediação tecnológica na produção de monumentos e na
  institucionalização do realismo histórico.

  No loading time, no cuts between levels

  How to play?
  .
  It is recommended to use an Xbox controller. But you can play with a keyboard or
  a touchscreen too, just activate the virtual gamepad in the Setup screen.

  .
  Virtual Reality

  You can turn on VR in the Setup screen. I only have a Google Cardboard, but
  maybe it will work with fancy headsets? Please give me feedback if you have the
  chance to play with such a device

  Development note
  .
  Omeganaut is still under construction, using the awesome ZGameEditor, which
  allows a tiny footprint, and two external libraries for physics and modular
  music.
  .
  The downside of a tiny footprint in this modern world is that a few antivirus
  software will go nuts and return a false positive. It's annoying, but there's no
  reason to worry. I like making games, not viruses.
  .
  By buying the game, you help me to continue making it. Right now, I focus on
  building the engine and getting rid of all the bugs, while adding new enemy
  ships and obstacles now and then.
  .
  Thanks

  Ever have one of those days?
  .
  You know, when you wake up on the wrong side of the bed chained to a hexagram?
  It happens to everyone, right? Well, it's happening to Murphy. The problem is he
  doesn't know how he got there. Or who might want to put him in such a
  predicament. Or if those orbs are really blood red or just a mildly unsettling
  shade of vermilion.
  .
  This is where you come in. You see, Murphy needs help recalling all the signs
  and portends that may have led him to where he is now. After all, it's not like
  he's one of those heroes he may have heard about. No. Just an unpaid intern, and
  not necessarily the brightest of the bunch, even. It could be that he MAY have
  done something. Then again, things just have a habit of HAPPENING around Murphy.
  Regardless, you'll guide him through his village, through creepy back rooms of
  shady establishments, and through his own faulty memory to find the truth in
  this Adventure/RPG. Just try not to get him killed too much along the way.

  Upon finding the entrance to an apparently abandoned bunker, the two become

  fellow members, and invites them to "stay for the party" and wait for the "New

  similarly meet their deaths down there if they don't escape, and they still have
  to find their all important cure!

  .
  The last thing you remember is receiving an unsatisfying answer. A plunge
  through the fundamental chaos takes you to a place of bones. Great power can be
  found within the Ossuary, but those who are not lying to themselves are lying to
  you.
  .
  Ossuary is a dark, funny, puzzling game about talking to people and corrupting
  them with sins that are really virtues. It's a stark, unsettling satire where
  you cure cabbages of being people and expose the terrible lies that we tell
  ourselves so we don't have to change. It's inspired by Discordianism, a
  postmodern nonsense religion.
  .
  The prequel demo, The Hodge-Podge Transformer, can be downloaded for free and
  consists of story, dialogue, and puzzles that don't appear in the full game.

  Ossuary was designed by Gregory Avery-Weir, creator of "(I Fell in Love With)
  The Majesty of Colors," "How to Raise a Dragon," and "Looming."

  Other Minds is a pixel art style game where you play as Ed and Sage. Ed is your
  human who you can use for your standard platforming action, whereas Sage can fly
  around freely and take control of any other character.
  .
  You will take advantage of the other character's abilities to solve puzzles,
  beat levels and uncover the nefarious plot of Dr Death. Ed and Sage must save
  the world because everybody else is too busy standing around thinking about
  things.
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  4 hours+ of classic platforming action with puzzles, collectibles and tough
  bosses
  .
  Use Sage, a floating green consciousness, to possess and take control of
  basically anything that moves
  .
  Loads of secrets and collectibles which are used to unlock time trials and
  rhythm levels
  .
  Mostly made by one person

  .
  The lands of Fyra are a harsh, cold, and unforgiving wasteland; traits the
  people that inhabit it have inherited. When their children reach maturity, some
  are sent to guard the land's borders - told never to return without either a
  trespasser or completing a Journey delivered by the Gods. In exchange, their
  families are guaranteed food and shelter in the harsh lands for as long as their
  children man the wall; in the end, many die on the border - waiting for
  intruders who do not come or Gods who will not speak with them.
  .
  Iyu is one of those who was fated to guard the border. He has survived 30
  withering years in the biting cold and, now an adult, is plagued with visions of
  death and dying alone. His resolve is tested as the Gods finally deliver him the
  means to take the first step on his journey - a meeting with the Goddess of
  Death. It seems that in order to go home alive, first he must die trying.
  .
  Ouroboros: The Sacrifice is a short-length (40-80 minute) first-person horror-
  themed adventure game. Includes professional voice-acting, hand-drawn
  backgrounds and characters, and an atmospheric soundtrack.

  Or perhaps you trust the Veteran armed with his old rifle and wits, he's headed
  out to the pits to blow these zombies to bits.
  .
  Not all heroes have hearts of gold. The Gangster just got a shipment of brand
  new submachine guns from the port! He's taking to the world court without escort
  to cut short these monsters plans. After all, you can't extort a dead city.
  .
  Lastly, this diner dame may just be a Waitress, but a girls gotta have some
  skills to keep the wolves away. Now she's serving up some lead to these
  dangerous dead.
  .
  No matter who you choose you'll need to try your best to save people at five
  different levels. Each character's level has new enemy spawn points so be sure

  But sometimes that isn't so easy. It definitely isn't for Diego Foxglove, a
  6'4'' former drug dealer who sprouts mutant mouths and turns into a giant wolf-
  dog to fight killer alien fungus. If it's not the vague specter of society
  looking down on him for being an immigrant, an Excentric, or both, it's faces
  from his tangled past coming back to quite literally give him grief. Diego wants
  nothing more than to keep his head down and away from the many things troubling
  him, but that seems all but impossible.

  Except it isn't- because as it turns out, Diego has one more ability that he
  never knew about. A different form. Something smaller, more inconspicuous,
  more... fluffy?

  PAGAN: AUTOGENY
  .
  A thousand worlds surround our own, composed of bits and bytes. When they die,
  where do they go; what secrets do they hide?
  .
  Stumble ye, wayfarer, through the wreckage of a dead MMO.
  .
  PAGAN: Autogeny is an experimental first person open world role playing game set
  in the digital ruins of a largely abandoned MMORPG. It is heavily inspired by
  long-forgotten bargain-bin 1990s adventure games, and by a general ethos of
  user-hostile design. Features include:
  .
  > Over 100 acres of lovingly handcrafted playable space
  .
  > An increasingly esoteric series of secret endings
  .
  > Five major zones + a litany of hidden areas
  .
  > Four idiosyncratic repeatable boss fights
  .
  > Over 7000 possible gear combinations
  .
  > Five strange and eldritch skills
  .
  > Very cursed gender_magick
  .
  PAGAN: Autogeny is an exercise in aesthetic maximalism - In other words, it's
  pretty big, at least by normal altGame standards. A full adventure will take
  several hours, but you can return to spawn at any point to save and exit. The
  game also autosaves when passing through doors, in case you have to run off in a
  hurry.
  .
  Good luck, wayfarer, and God Speed.

  2021 Update: Unfortunately Apple makes it nearly impossible for small devs to
  maintain older software on their platform. This game just isn't selling enough
  at this point in its life for me to dump the time into it to meet Apple's
  current standards. It makes me sad, but I'm removing the Mac/iOS version so that
  people don't download something they can't use.

description:
  Path Out is is an autobiographical adventure game that allows the players to
  replay the journey of Abdullah Karam, a young Syrian artist that escaped the
  civil war in 2014. Camouflaged as a Japanese RPG, Path Out is a tale full of
  surprises, challenges and paradoxical humor, giving insight in this real-life
  adventure, on which Abdullah comments through youtube-style videos in the game.
  .
  Features:
  .
  JRPG based on real events
  .
  Relive Abdullahs escape from war-torn syria.
  .
  Unique neo-orchestral electronica music with oriental influences by
  wobblersound.
  .
  Meticulously researched pixel art style inspired by classic 16-bit games and
  Syrian art
  .
  Video commentary by Abdullah Karam
  .
  Path Out is an episodic game. In this very first chapter  of the adventure ,
  Abdullah recalls life before the war, a family decision that led to his
  departure and the perilous journey from his hometown Hama to the Turkish border
  through the war-torn Aleppo province. In its final version of up to five
  episodes, the game should take the player on a journey from Syria through
  Turkey, Greece and the Balkan until he finally arrives at his destination (and
  current whereabout) in Central Europe.
  .
  Path Out is a collaboration between Abdullah Karam, the developers of Causa
  Creations, Wobblersound and the Austrian-American graphic designer Brian Main.
  .
  Press voices:
  .
  Path Out's first episode is a straightforward but eye-opening work.
  .
  - Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, Eurogamer.net
  .
  ... one of the most honest & clever games I've ever played, by & about a Syrian
  refugee.
  .
  - Rami Ismail, Twitter
  .
  Yet in asking a person to assume his place in a game, Karam makes his story
  engaging on an individual level, and his appearance in the videos further
  humanizes his story, especially through his humor...

  You're the Damned One, a reptilian Fallen Holy Warrior, seeking for Penance to
  atone for your sins against your kind. You have been given a task: Go through
  the gates of Hell and destroy all the sin you can see.

  You start with your sword and pistol, and you will find more weapons in the

  The goal of the endless mode is simple: Cause enough carnage and earn points
  from each kill, collect keys each level to get through the portals, then show
  off your highscore to your friends.
  .
  The game has a Discord support, so people can see your score while playing and
  also which campaign level you are on. If you get high enough score, you will get
  the ending cutscene. Penance also has simple bunnyhopping that increases your
  speed, crouch-sliding and a rage mechanic, that when activated, gives you double
  damage to all weapons, except the sword does quadruple damage.

  I haven't tested controller with this game, it was created for mouse and
  keyboard in mind.
  .
  This game was simply made for fun, because it's something I felt like I wanted
  to play and I love oldschool style FPS games. It's probably not that difficult
  game for FPS players, but I am proud of this game and I find it fun and
  satisfying to play. Due to the overwhelming popularity I also made the campaign
  mode, which let me practice proper level design.
  .
  I used a lot of feedback I got from Ironscale and Castle Rodok to make this
  game, but also learned a lot of new things. I hope you have as much fun playing
  Penance as I had making it!

  Why have a pet rock when you can have a pet planet? Micromanage this cosmic
  massive rock from its humble beginnings and take its people to places they never
  thought possible! Sure, you can teach them about food and science, but what if
  you take some liberties with evolution?

  You've got a planet, and you have to decide what happens to it. But being the
  boss is such a tiring job, so you have to take a century long rest after every
  decision. Let's hope they can manage without you for that long. Every action you
  take can change the tiny people's destiny!

  happen?

developer: PatDavisGames
publisher: PatDavisGames
genre: Sports
description:
  Basics:
  .
  Pin Puck is a high speed local multiplayer ice hockey inspired game for 1 - 4
  players. The aim is simple: sink the puck into your opponent's goals to score.
  .
  The 'Pin'
  .
  The curves on the front and sides of the Pin make manoeuvring the puck a
  difficult task. Rather than going directly for the puck, it's often much more
  effective to control the puck from the side in a circular motion. This makes the
  game a little difficult to begin with, but allows for a much greater level of
  precision and skill once the basics have been understood.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Battle it out in local multiplayer across 11 different arenas
  .
  Test yourself against the clock in 8 different single-player Target Smash levels
  .
  Play 1v1, 2v1 or 2v2 matches against your friends
  .
  Supported Controllers:
  .
  At least one controller is required to play Pin Puck, however a variety of
  popular game controllers are supported, including:
  .
  Xbox 360 Controller
  .
  Xbox One Controller
  .
  Sony Dualshock 4

  MAC AND LINUX USERS
  .
  Builds for MacOS and Linux are offered here, based on manifest interest on past
  titles. But please note that it is not possible on our end to do even basic
  testing on those versions, so there is a distinct possibility they might not
  work properly.
  .
  Moreover, since the new Catalina update, games made in Unity might not work
  properly or at all, and this is out of our control. If you are using MacOS
  Catalina and encounter issues with running the software, we most probably won't
  be able to help.
  .
  Please contact us if you come across any issues with those versions and we will
  see what can be done (if anything) to help create stable builds for those

game: Pleroma (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/P/Pleroma (USA)/Pleroma (USA).json
developer: Aleks Samoylov
publisher: Aleks Samoylov
genre: Puzzle
description:
  Pleroma is the very first commercial video game by notable and internationally
  beloved aesthete known primarily as The Aleks. It has been made possible through
  the generous support of a lovely batch of Kickstarter backers and, of course,
  patreon patrons.
  .
  Features!
  .
  Engage with a sprawling, gripping, freakadelic narrative written by award
  winning writer and IRIMA (Internationally Recognized Interactive Media Auteur)
  Aleks Samoylov.
  .
  Take in the sights and enjoy a distinctive, impressionistic, low poly
  presentation by award winning, classically trained painter (and IRIMA) Aleks
  Samoylov.
  .
  Enjoy experimental tunes by Internationally Recognized Musician (IRM)
  Monplaisir.
  .
  Explore an atmospheric, open ended world, full of secrets, mysteries, surprises,
  and non-player characters eager for a chat, and do so at your own pace.
  .
  Solve a puzzle and unlock the "true ending," if you're so inclined.
  .
  Wield the mighty Tuner and engage in Tuner based actions!
  .
  Take a guided tour of a significant archaeological site, check out some abstract
  art in a hip gallery, mingle with important guests at a party / political
  summit, go spelunking, get lost in a twisted maze, or try to figure out what is
  really going on.
  .
  What's this game about?
  .
  Well, it's a freakadelic, surreal "puzzle box" (it has one actual puzzle, which
  is optional - unless you want the "true ending" that is), a set of dreamy,
  interconnected environments for the player to explore, experience, and unravel
  at their leisure. There is no shooting in it, and no jump scares. There are some
  bits that people may consider mildly spooky (or even spoopy), but I would not
  classify it as a horror in any conventional sense, unless you consider
  existential angst to be horrifying, which you should.
  .
  If you're still unclear as to what genre this game falls into, it is definitely
  a first person "walking simulator," optional puzzle elements notwithstanding,
  you will spend the majority of the game exploring and reading stuff. There is a
  fair bit here to explore ... and a lot to read.
  .
  What's the story, fishbone?
  .
  In Pleroma, you will take on the role of Diane Kestler, a youthful individual
  who has recently moved to a new part of town and is starting a new job at a
  niche art gallery / studio collective / research library which is (you guessed
  it!) hiding a rather surprising and unusual secret. I hesitate to reveal more,
  as I know that many folks are spoiler averse, and personally I would like
  players to discover and interpret this game for themselves.
  .

  price, but would still like to help financially support me as an artist and game

  Current build: 1.2
  .
  1.2 Updates:
  .
  - Fixed major issue with the puzzle not registering correct input (I done
  goofed).
  .
  - Some improvements to framerate in the All Hail scene on lower end machines.
  .
  Known bugs:
  .
  - It's possible that the Vsync option (available through the pause menu) will do
  the opposite of what it's supposed to. So, if the checkbox is off, Vsync is on
  and vice versa. If you're getting screen tearing, play around with the two
  settings. One of them ought to work! (I'll likely patch this up later, but it
  shouldn't significantly affect your experience).

  Possession is a traditional turn-based roguelike where you play as a ghost
  trying to make your way to the surface. You are incredibly frail, but have one
  advantage: you can possess the bodies of the monsters you encounter, and use
  their strength and abilities as your own. Hop from body to body as you attempt
  to make it back to the surface.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Dozens of possessable monsters, from the horrifying to the hilarious, with a
  wide variety of powers.
  .
  Special themed levels with unique hazards, creatures and layouts. Randomly
  generated, and each floor has multiple possible levels, so each playthrough is
  different!
  .
  Item-less gameplay. The dead have no need for worldly possessions, they just
  slow you down.
  .
  Quick to pick up and play. Unlike most roguelikes, Possession doesn't require
  you to memorize dozens of weird key commands, or puzzle over confusing skill and
  ability lists before you start playing.
  .
  Entirely playable with just the keyboard, just the mouse, or a combination of
  the two.
  .
  Mod support! Add your own creatures, powers and special levels, or change the
  ones already there.
  .
  @ Choice between ASCII or Graphical mode, for the oldschool roguelike fans.

  Potato Thriller (Classic) is the original version (V1) of the game before making
  it onto Steam through the Steam Greenlight program. Originally launched April
  1st, 2016, Potato Thriller started here on itch.io and was my very first
  commercial game release ever. After launching on itch, I submitted Potato
  Thriller onto Steam's Greenlight program. The game got mixed reactions however,
  mostly where positive and many users were willing to give my game a chance on
  the Steam platform. To my surprise, I received an email from Valve a couple
  weeks later telling me that my game was greenlit to be launched on Steam. Potato
  Thriller received a pretty impressive number of "yes" votes from Steam community
  and I was filled with excitement and motivation. As a thanks, I created an
  updated special version of Potato Thriller just for Steam called: "Potato
  Thriller Steamed Potato Edition" which included many game enhancements, extra
  content and numerous game secrets. I have come really far as a game developer
  since this time and looking back at this game makes me realize what a silly and
  ridiculous project it was. I debated numerous times with myself if I should just
  delete if from itch.io but decided to keep it up forever as a reminder to
  myself. I realized that this game is such an important part of my history as a
  game developer and it shows how far I have come. It's an awkward, cringy and
  poorly made game with many faults. But it's also a game with a lot of heart and
  passion and i'm super proud of what I have created here and always will be. We
  all start somewhere and i'm proud to be able to say that Potato Thriller was my
  first "serious" game release.

  Grow plants, brew potions, maybe even solve a mystery
  .
  "Today marks the first day I was supposed to start as an apprentice for the
  esteemed magical botanist Arden Silvera. I arrived yesterday and I have yet to
  see any signs of them. I've found a couple of torn out pages of what seems to be
  their journal. Maybe they will be happy that I found them. Until then, this
  garden looks a bit run down, maybe I should get to work."
  .
  About the game
  .
  Potion Commotion is a cute farming game where you grow plants to gather
  resources and using those resources to brew magical potions with unique
  abilities. On the way, you will find torn out pages from your master Ardon
  Silvera that provide more details on the plants, the potion, the garden and what
  happened to them.
  .
  The game is quite straight forward. You click on seeds from your inventory and
  place them on a watered field. Fields can be watered with the Potion of
  Hydration, which can be made in the cauldron with 5 pieces of a Hydroangea
  flower. If you're ever confused, simply refer to the game's journal.
  .
  This is just the basics. The game has a 'How to play' section in the menu and
  the game will guide you along the way.

  10 different plants to grow

  15 unique potions to brew

  Every run ends in death.
  .
  Dive again.
  .
  Dive into Probability 0, the eternal descending platformer with roguelike
  tendencies.
  .
  I designed this game for myself:
  .
  Freely explore wildly different builds along a static skill tree. Chase the
  abilities that excite you. Try something different next time.
  .
  Each run strives to deliver a new experience. Your enemies spawn at strange and
  varied rates.
  .
  Each run strives to deliver a reliable experience. The game is focused on one
  thing: your struggle to survive a threatening landscape & its inhabitants.
  .
  Everything that lives in the pit is designed to be dangerous and unique.
  .
  As you go deeper, the game goes through pulsating waves of increased difficulty.
  Things get very different after 1km. (I rarely get this far. Honestly, the game
  may be a bit too hard? But if you're into that kind of thing, it's so satisfying
  to overcome the uncompromising obstacles that stand in your way.)
  .
  Listen to:
  .
  The layered soundtrack that shifts as the pit reveals itself to you.
  .
  The siren that screams as danger mounts.

  PUSH BLOCKS. FORM SQUARES.    OR DIE TRYING!
  .
  Pushamo is an arcade push-em-up that challenges you to organize different shapes
  into squares to clear blocks and earn points! It's no easy task, though - as you
  push on, shapes will come faster and more frequently until you find yourself as
  overwhelmed as you are engrossed.
  .
  Satisfying core game loop: An creative take on the block-clearing genre that
  offers endless replayability and high-scoring
  .
  Many ways to play: Point Rush, 2P Coop, Puzzles, Challenges, and more modes lead
  to a massive variety of play experiences
  .
  8 bits of awesome: Authentic retro experience built in PICO-8
  .
  CREATE HUGE COMBOS
  .
  By forming large clears you can earn massive amounts of points and unleash a
  shower of visual effects. This strategic combo system also rewards you for all
  kinds of special clears, from Risky to Tidy to Back 2 Back, and many more!
  .
  Celebrate and share your most awesome combos with the press of a button - F4 -
  to record the last 8 seconds of gameplay as a lightweight GIF!
  .
  BREAK THE RULES
  .
  Challenge Mode presents over a dozen diverse rule variations on the already
  addicting core gameplay! These inventive scenarios range from wonderfully wacky
  to fiendishly difficult to ingeniously imaginative:
  .
  Swap out the familiar tetrominos with some less orthodox shapes
  .
  All the blocks are invisible after stopping
  .
  You're also playing snake now, at the same time
  .
  And many more!
  .
  SIT BACK AND RELAX
  .
  Pushamo also offers plenty of calmer experiences for when you want to chill and
  zone out, and want a less stressful time:
  .
  Play endlessly without blocks ever increasing in speed in Zendless mode.
  .
  Think over each and every move in the tactical Turn-Based mode! Here, blocks
  will wait patiently for you to decide your next move before they go anywhere.
  .
  Ponder over the perplexing Puzzle mode, where you're presented with 32 hand-
  crafted puzzles that ask you to use all blocks in a single clear.
  .
  CUSTOMIZE YOUR EXPERIENCE
  .
  Choose between two awesome music tracks
  .
  Select your favorite color palette from a choice of 16, including 8 different
  pride patterns!
  .
  Turn off (or multiply!) all visual effects including particles, screen shake,
  and background animation
  .
  Reclaim your free time with a handy "unlock all" option, to let you try all
  Pushamo has to offer without worrying about score requirements getting in the
  way

  because they are garbage - and I mean, if you really think about it, no one ever
  goes "aw, look at that cute goose over there". The Geese are aware of that: it
  makes them unstable.

  Long story short, they want DUCKSTER'S eggs but he's not going to let it happen,
  because like I said earlier he might have a dependency issue with the eggs.

  "Games like Quiet as a Stone remind me of how beautiful and genuinely cool is it
  to be so engrossed with an artificial space. I've gone from level to level until
  I've found the perfect arrangement of ruins, zooming in close to admire them
  before framing them with my camera with the perfect combination of distance,
  light, and color. It helped me to see the beauty in small things: the errant
  blade of grass that slid into view, a serendipitously-shaped rock heap, the
  flickering heat of a fire slithering through mist. And it was all right at my
  fingertips."

  "Sometimes I plant gardens, build ruins, and erect mysterious circles of
  monoliths. Sometimes I look around the different landscapes, watching day and

  Wishlisting us on steam helps a lot!
  .
  **Warning, this game deals with mature content and themes.**
  .
  Five axolotls appear one day through a void, their entire existence shrouded in
  mystery. A story chock-full of surprises, best experienced blind.
  .
  Taking place in a tank suspended upon a cosmic wonderland, five axolotls appear
  one day from a mysterious, thundering void. They quickly learn they are able to
  speak with one another, and relationships are formed. However, something is off.
  Each axolotl seems to possess knowledge they should not know. Foods, and people,
  and places and concepts...
  .
  And obsessions.
  .
  Amid conspiracies, illness', fights to the death, VR headsets, and bizarre
  reality switching, a figure named [RB] seems to be pulling the strings behind it
  all.
  .
  Features
  .
  *A mystery with over 10 hours of content. Surprises await ye' at every turn
  traveler!
  .
  *Press 'S' at various points in the story to perform the world's greatest
  somersault! I cannot overstate this: THE WORLD'S GREATEST SOMERSAULT! Axy worked
  quite hard to gain that title, you know.
  .
  *Choose carefully! There will be at least one choice in the game, maybe two
  choices, perhaps even fifty choices!!! But none of which will affect your
  playthrough whatsoever, so don't worry about them and ignore this bullet point.
  .
  *Dynamic movements bursting with personality and tweens! Each scene is
  handcrafted with care and love, and none look the same. The screenshots do not
  do it justice!
  .
  *Maybe a funny thing like a giant axolotl... or maybe an axolotl cosplaying as
  human? Some mildly funny or maybe even moderately funny thing might happen when
  intense plot beats aren't occurring! Sometimes they might even happen while
  they're occurring! :O
  .
  *We have an OST! It's really great! 3 people worked on it, including the author!
  .
  * There's a Breaking Bad reference, an Umineko reference, and a Rugrats
  reference... Has this holy trinity ever been referenced before in one piece of
  media?
  .
  Surely, there are many things that can be said, but RB: Axolotl is unlike
  anything you've ever seen before.
  .
  This is an emotional tale that I built with all the passion and love in my
  heart.
  .
  Despite its cute art style, the visual novel RB: Axolotl is intended for mature
  audiences only.
  .
  MATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION
  .
  The developers describe the content like this:
  .
  Contains depictions of depression, anxiety, and implied suicide. Also contains
  harsh language.

  Trust System Sliding Scale Pricing
  .
  This game took me quite a long time to write! I also make a living from my art:
  I don't have another job. And I'm really proud of it and want it to be valued.
  But I also know that the market value of any given piece of digital art is
  effectively zero, and that many of the folk who might want to play this aren't
  earning much money either, and that most of the economic options available to us
  aren't particularly palatable, and that I want you to play this more than I want
  to get paid. So here's my suggestion.
  .
  I've set 4 as a rough price for this game based on a triangulation of how long
  it took me, how much I hope to sell, how experienced I am, how the art market
  functions, how much I think folk are willing to pay, and sheer guesswork.
  (Mostly guesswork.) If you're earning an average wage (UK: c26k) then pay me
  that. If you're earning more, pay me more. If you're earning less, pay me less.
  If you're earning less than the Living Wage (UK: c16k) then don't pay me
  anything, and I hope you enjoy the game. This system isn't policed, and if
  you've got a better idea of how artists should make a living (I hope you do!)
  then pay whatever you think is right.

  Alternatively, support me on Patreon from a buck a month and get access to all
  the work I make for no extra charge.

  A creativity-driven RPG about a rundown theatre and pleasing its unruly
  clientele.
  .
  Nobody said that opening a theatre on the wrong side of the river was going to
  be easy! The roof may be leaking, and the audience may be armed to the teeth,
  but nothing is going to stop the Rainsdowne Players from becoming the premier
  (and only!) theatre troupe in town!
  .
  Features:
  .
  Correctly handle 'friendly encouragement' from your audience, in the form of
  thrown bottles, tomatoes and even the occasional fish.
  .
  Collect inspiration cards from the audience, and combine them to concoct new
  plays to please the pickier customers.
  .
  Hang out with a homeless cat who likes board games.
  .
  Convince the ticket desk clerk not to leave her dead end job.
  .
  Survive a boss battle in the form of several hundred disinterested
  schoolchildren.
  .
  Plays like if Paper Mario and Majora's Mask had a child, but the father was
  secretly Rhythm Tengoku.
  .
  The Rainsdowne Players is an RPG about winning hearts and minds. Explore the
  town of Rainsdowne and get to know the peculiar inhabitants, all of whom may
  have a particular play they want to see, even if they don't realise it yet!
  Gather inspiration in the form of cards and use it to build the narrative of
  your next show, but it's never quite that simple and whether dodging projectiles
  or surviving a sword fight, you've got to actually make it through the
  performance in one piece!
  .
  A note from the Rainsdowne Tourist Board:
  .
  Due to a faulty and irreversible weather charm several hundred years ago, the
  town of Rainsdowne does get an awful lot of rain, but don't let that dampen your
  spirits! There's lots to see and do around town:
  .
  Try and sink some questionably depicted pirates at the cannon range.
  .
  Take part in our lively card battling scene. There's always a tournament
  running.
  .
  Enjoy some surprisingly relaxing fishing by the docks.
  .
  Enjoy some surprisingly non-relaxing yoga in the park.
  .
  Take to the stage at the Royal Flush bar, which was definitely not a public
  washroom only a few weeks ago.
  .
  Also available on Nintendo Switch!

  PLEASE NOTE: Ports to systems other than Windows (64bit) are sold UNTESTED.
  .
  I DO NOT have the means to test these ports, and you are hereby being made aware
  of this if you're thinking of buying them. Thank you for your co-operation.
  .
  Your itch.io purchase of reIterate comes with a Steam Key (assuming I've set it
  up properly)!
  .
  Spawning from popular YouTube channel, "Let's Talk Game Design", reIterate is a
  modern-classic retro-styled 2D precision platformer, with a focus on fluidity
  and motion, that adheres to some philosophically valid (well, I think so,
  anyway) game design practices.
  .
  Now including Source Project file for Construct 3! See how this shoddy wreck is
  a minor miracle in actually coming out at all!
  .
  "reIterate, much like the channel that spawned it, is a lesson in game design" -
  RoseTintedSpectrum
  .
  reIterate is a fast-paced 2D platformer with a focus on precision and fluidity,
  with a strong contrasting aesthetic and a retro-future soundtrack.
  .
  reIterate has a classic purity that's all about getting from the beginning to
  the end, navigating familiar but challenging hazards like spikes, spikes, some
  spikes, and also, some spikes. They rotate, they spin, they shoot out at you,
  and sometimes, they just sit there.
  .
  Along the way, you'll master wall-jumping, double-jumping, bouncing, springs,
  vanishing platforms, moving platforms and even portals as you leap from level to
  geometric level, moving along, up and down the screen to put in your best
  possible performance over 60 challenging and varied stages.
  .
  Then you can leap into the dedicated Speedrun Mode to really test your abilities
  and (possibly) become a Twitch sensation with your mad speedrunning skills.
  .
  reIterate is ultimately designed to represent a game from a theoretical retro
  console that never actually existed. Something old and familiar, yet also a
  little bit different and strange. And always, always fun to play.
  .
  FEATURES:
  .
  More than 60 hand-crafted levels, designed with a meticulous philosophy
  .
  Optional collectibles for that extra challenge
  .
  Unlockable backstory segments and fully skippable cutscenes to add lore and
  depth to the experience
  .
  Dedicated Speedrun Mode
  .
  A much harder Black Edition mode, where every level has been remixed and
  redesigned to push you to your limits.
  .
  Dedicated 'Time Slow' for accessibility. Stuck on a particular bit? Slow down
  time to a third of its regular speed, and take your time with the challenge.
  .
  A Jukebox system, putting you in charge of your background music playlist
  .
  Geometric shapes and simple contrast built together into a pleasing aesthetic
  .
  Uncapped framerate for silky smoothness
  .
  And more, probably!

  BONUS - Cellpop Goes Out At Night
  .
  Texas is launching on itch.io with an all-new mini-sequel, Cellpop Goes Out At
  Night. The sequel is included in the Dusty Skies Edition.
  .
  Grab the bundle, here: The Real Texas - Dusty Skies Edition
  .
  The Dusty Skies Edition is only 50 cents more than the base game-- please buy
  that instead! :)
  .
  Customers who already purchased The Real Texas before July 12, 2016 will recieve
  the Dusty Skies Edition FREE. It's my way of saying "Thank you!" to the fans who
  have bought the game over the years.
  .
  OVERVIEW
  .
  "These days, folks have a lot of funny ideas about what makes a Real Cowboy..."
  .
  The Real Texas is an action adventure game that plays like a mashup of Zelda:
  Link to the Past and Ultima VI.
  .
  Sam, an ordinary Texas rancher, is on holiday in England when he steps through a
  blue portal and into a purgatory dimension, Strange:
  .
  Here, a friendly witch is handing out guns to visitors. A crazed, German-
  speaking wizard hurls elecbolts from his castle. And upriver, something's going
  on that involves a lot of chickens.
  .
  Stuck in the middle sits Sam, a Real Cowboy.
  .
  ... But that's just his job title back home-- it's not obvious that it's of any
  practical help here!
  .
  USER REVIEWS
  .
  The game has been out for awhile-- here's some reviews from other sites:
  .
  "This thing is like some bizarre voxel dream, with its square, swaggerin'
  cowboys and its castles and insane German wizard-scientists and talking rats . .
  . It's fun and beautiful and a little bit rough on purpose, and I suppose I'll
  never forget it." - Abram03
  .
  "i will never forget this surreal nostalgic ride. i haven't had such a rewarding
  experience in a long time." - countersweet
  .
  "This game is incredible and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone." -
  Microwave
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Kill things with six types of classic cowboy and fantasy weapons
  .
  Rummage through peoples' houses without fear of retribution while they go about
  their daily business
  .
  Help people out with their PROBLEMS (*rolls eyes*) often by shooting your gun
  many, many times-- just like real life!
  .
  Many special items and powerups, optional areas, and two types of chicken
  cutlets to collect
  .
  Wear a bullet-proof vest underneath a sequined evening-gown if you want
  .
  Supports all main game/life perlis including boss battles, enemies, traps, the
  estate tax
  .
  IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER NOTES
  .
  For the re-release I added achievements, improved the framerate, added more
  compatibility options, and optimized things generally.
  .
  Even without the mini-sequel it's a lot improved over the original release. But
  I was careful to NOT ret-conn the original game. People seemed to really like
  it, so I wanted to respect that by not changing it up in any way.
  .
  To complete The Real Texas takes maybe about 10 hours, depending on what you
  want to do. Cellpop Goes Out At Night might take about 1-2 hours. Both the main
  game and the sequel have lots of secrets and weird things to uncover. In fact,
  there are some things that still haven't been figured out (to my knowledge) in
  four years... So I made it an achievement. Ha-ha! Good luck. :)
  .
  I've put a lot of love into both of these games, and I hope you will find them
  special and enjoyable. Thanks!

  About the Game
  .
  Concept
  .
  In 2015 I released an album, entitled Refactor. Several of the tracks started
  out as OSTs for aborted game projects, and most of the others were inspired by
  my love of video game music in general. I wanted to make some music videos for
  the songs to pay homage to the games that inspired them
  .
  In 2017 I quit my job to go indie, and figured that I should make a bunch of
  small, simple games while I figured out what I wanted to be doing long-term.
  .
  These separate ideas were refactored into a single one.
  .
  Early Access
  .
  Because this game will be in development for quite some time, I am providing
  early access to the game as I work on it. As I push new builds fairly
  frequently, the best way to play is via the itch.io app.
  .
  Since many of the tracks are produced for game jams, I will always have a
  freely-downloadable version for any current jam that the game is submitted for
  so that other participants may evaluate the jam submission.
  .
  If you want to give feedback about the game so far, feel free to use the comment
  section here on itch, or come find me on Discord!

game: Retromancer (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/R/Retromancer (USA)/Retromancer (USA).json
developer: Spinfoam Games
publisher: Spinfoam Games
genre: Action
description:
  What would happen if an insane wizard set up shop on a cursed island and decided
  to blend the dark arts of necromancy and ... nostalgia?
  .
  They'd become a Retromancer. And you'd have to hunt them down; probably in some
  kind of intense, pixelated, twin stick shooter.
  .
  Choose Your Champion
  .
  Select one of four different characters to match your play style (or master all
  of them, to prove your skills):
  .
  The barbarian is slow but sturdy, hurling massive axes towards their enemies and
  charging forward recklessly. There's also a lot of yelling. Deadly yelling.
  .
  The mage keeps their distance and blasts foes with arcane bolts that steer
  themselves to the nearest target. Hang back and shred the air with razor sharp
  magical shards.
  .
  The hunter darts in and out of combat, sniping at monsters with fast-firing and
  long-ranged arrows then darting out of the way.
  .
  The cleric's greatest strength is their faith, which happens to let them fill
  the air with spheres of holy light that explode and tear apart the creatures
  around them. When their devotion is especially strong, they might even be
  blessed with free armor.
  .
  No matter which you choose, you'll level up as you fight through the
  Retromancer's forces, gaining damage bonuses and recovering armor as you go.
  .
  Arm Yourself Against the Madness
  .
  Take advantage of weapons and power ups to deal more damage, fire faster, dodge
  enemies, and freeze monsters in their tracks.
  .
  Unlock permanent upgrades between games that enhance each character's strengths:
  mages get even more rapid fire, clerics get more blessings from their gods,
  hunters become even more deadly at range, and barbarians yell louder than ever
  before!
  .
  Defy Death
  .
  A unique death's door mechanic gives you a fighting chance to come back from the
  brink of death.
  .
  Enlist Your Friends
  .
  If the Retromancer is too much to tackle alone, you can recruit up to three
  friends in the local 4-player co-op mode.
  .
  When you do have your friends with you, you'll be able to revive each other when
  you fall in battle, so you'll never be stuck fighting alone.
  .
  Survive The Journey
  .
  Battle through 30 stages spread across 6 areas on the cursed island of Qor,
  challenging a vast array of crazed monsters ranging from rats and beetles to
  sentient trees and extra-dimensional horrors.
  .
  Endure a plague of locusts in the haunted woods, overthrow a cultist army in the
  ruins, surrender your sanity to the creatures of the Void, and kill the
  Retromancer.
  .
  Feature Summary
  .
  4 characters to master
  .
  Unique death's door and multi-player revival mechanics
  .
  Up to 4 player local co-op
  .
  Both controller and keyboard & mouse support

developer: Chequered Ink

genre: Adventure
description:
  It's 2038, and a late maniacal inventor has left behind a legacy of madness -
  coordinates to an island full of wealthy robots, a gun that asks questions, and
  a widow that's hired you to answer them.
  .
  As Izzy Buspec, the newest recruit to Randco, take charge of their patented
  revolver as you explore the densely packed biomes of Corvynnia, bringing down
  hordes of docile robots in a money-making adventure. Every time you fire, you'll
  have to answer one of over 4,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers,
  percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual
  answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run
  out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!
  .
  Revolver and Co features 165 story levels across 11 unique worlds and 20
  question themes which will test you on a wide range of subjects, tied together
  with humorous debriefings between Izzy and her maniacal boss before the start of
  each mission.
  .
  Or if you're looking for more of a challenge, have a go at one of the Endless
  challenges, which pits you against a barrage of questions until you finally
  succumb to an empty revolver chamber. You can even unlock more Endless
  challenges by completing the story levels, including a gruelling hour-long
  session where the only thing you have to lose is time.

  .
  "For three bucks on Steam it's a no-brainer if you're looking for a good way to
  kill time before bed or, if you're a true sneaky mastermind, at work while you
  should be writing memos and whatnot." - Game Space
  .
  "Nearly everything about this game is an absolute delight..." - Steam Shovelers
  .
  "The game, needless to say, is very funny. With multiple locations, blocky
  visuals and a jaunty soundtrack, Ripped Pants at Work is a delightful blast of
  stealth-based fun." - Red Bull Games
  .
  Ripped Pants at Work is a frantic stealth game about searching for new pants.
  Players control an ordinary office worker on their first day of work. After an
  unfortunate incident involving a pencil on the floor and pants that were way too
  tight, the player must venture out of the office and into the city on a hunt for
  new pants.
  .
  Explore a small, open city filled with different pairs of pants! Players can
  challenge themselves to find the most pants in the shortest amount of time. Some
  pants are easy to find. Some are a bit trickier!
  .
  This happens to everybody! Ripping your pants is one of those things that
  everyone can sympathize with, but it's still so embarrassing. Every time you
  play, you'll control a new, randomly generated character!
  .
  If you find pants successfully, you'll continue as the same person. If you get
  caught with no pants, you'll be fired and play as the next person hired for the
  job!
  .
  Sneak through a small, open-world, city, full of unique locations and people.
  .
  Break line of sight, hide behind people and in bushes, and run across streets
  and through buildings with a unique brand of frantic stealth.
  .
  Play the game as a different, randomly generated character every time. If you
  get caught pantsless by too many people, you'll get fired for indecency. The
  cycle continues with the next person to get hired for your job.
  .
  Best your personal record and see how many pairs of pants you can get in the
  shortest amount of time!

publisher: RISK SYSTEM
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  In the distant future, humanity has discovered a method to replicate matter
  through the use of a Dimensional Gate. Industry is revolutionized overnight and
  a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common
  banner.
  .
  A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a
  new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the
  Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were
  replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against
  them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those
  exposed.
  .
  In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of
  Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and
  use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot
  previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite
  control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her
  the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.
  .
  GAME PLAY:
  .
  -Increase your B-Meter & firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as
  possible and absorbing their energy. The closer you fly, the more energy you
  net!
  .
  -Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform
  powerful "Risk Shots". Enemies destroyed by these powered up shots will turn
  into energy to power your shield. The best defense is a risky offense!
  .
  -Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space
  & modify your attack!
  .
  -Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on
  everything in sight!
  .
  -Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive
  bursts of destruction and taking risks! Destroy multiple enemies at once and
  utilize "Risk Shots" to string together combos and increase your score
  multiplier!
  .
  -Experience different facets and paths to the story based on your performance
  and actions taken during missions!

  It's Monday TTRPG Night at Screen Time arcade!
  .
  Everyone in the town of Fernweh knows and adores Sophia, the sweet co-owner of
  Screen Time arcade. Well, almost everyone. Sophia is tired of avoiding
  confrontation and keeping herself small. She wants to be a strong woman, but
  WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
  .
  You decide.
  .
  Play as Sophia, a trans Chinese American arcade owner, as she explores her
  identity via TTRPG games! Written with cultural consultants and sensitivity
  readers, R4C captures what it feels like to proudly declare who you are to the
  world, particularly if speaking softly is your normal.
  .
  A love letter to the Toadhouse trans community and TTRPG enthusiasts.

  Playtime: A "one-shot" length of 60 minutes.

  "Not only does Roll For Confidence thoughtfully portray a trans woman, it also
  takes a great look at TTRPGs 'going wrong.' "  - Beatrix Livesey-Stephens
  (Artificial Womb)
  .
  TTRPG and the Power of Games
  .
  Many people have used video games and TTRPG characters to experiment with
  different aspects of their self-expression. Roll for Confidence highlights how
  useful of a tool games can be, especially for the trans community. Sophia rolls
  various different characters and chats with her friends about their characters
  and what it feels like to be a trans woman, as she tries to figure out what
  feels best for her IRL.
  .
  Cultural Awareness
  .
  Roll for Confidence takes place in a fictional Northeast coastal town in the
  United States called Fernweh (pronounced Fern - Vee), with a strong LGBTQIA+ and
  diverse community. Toadhouse Games has reached out to the communities we aim to
  represent to ensure we do so in an accurate and respectful manner. We also hire
  cultural consultants and sensitivity readers.

  ROOM EXPLORER 2010: DELUXE LOVER'S PAQUE is a DELUXE paque for lovers that
  features many DELUXE goodies for fans of the 2021 PC game ROOM EXPLORER 2010. I
  have constructed it as somewhat of a "deconstructed art-book". a beautiful
  DELUXE trek through the creation of my first real videogame for the computer.
  .
  DELUXE Contents:
  .
  A very lightly retouched windows build of RXP2010, based off the previously WET
  GAMIN exclusive HTML5 build.
  .
  The full RXP2010 source code For Gamemaker Studio 2. In all its  un-commented
  beauty.
  .
  All original image and sound assets from the game. Sorted into folders for your
  convenience.
  .
  A variety of TXT files that describe the history or otherwise give commentary on
  most of the aforementioned assets. Also for your convenience.
  .
  A larger variety of screenshots that were taken during the game's development.
  Many oddities to be seen. Not all of them directly depicting the game's
  development, but most of them likely affecting it or being an effect of it in
  some way.
  .
  The original PSD files for all assets that have one!
  .
  A 1 hour long modular synthesizer jam session, from someone who has never
  touched  a modular setup before recording it (me). It only appears as a 5 second
  soundbite in the HTML5 build.
  .
  And a few much less exciting things that I don't feel the need to list here.
  .
  Overall, due to my inexperience at the time I was constructing this game, I
  don't think the contents will be very - strictly speaking - "useful" to anyone.
  But I hope they prove to be insightful or at the very least interesting. Thanks!
  .
  note: the version of RXP2010 and its related contents within have been lightly
  changed for this DELUXE paque. for various reasons, largely to make it purchase-
  for-money-able. I think what was changed should be pretty obvious if the
  original is still fresh in memory.
  .
  (warning: this game contains some [non-pointed, nobody's hurting anyone else]
  cartoon depictions of injury.)

  "Thanks for trying out the latest dimension in Game Boy games!"
  .
  For April Fools Day 2020, I took my GB Studio project, "Rulent Tower", the
  adventures of a bunch of parody furry characters in an apartment building
  together, and "converted" it to VR. I only had a few days to smash it together,
  so the scope had to be restrictive, and a lot of things were left on the table.
  After April Fools, I spent a few extras weeks tinkering with the project, until
  I was satisfied.
  .
  But it's now 2021, and Oculus has released the Quest 2, running at 120 Hz
  (effectively 120 Frames per Second)! The original Quest version was locked at 72
  Hz. The change itself was relatively simple (once I could find the information),
  but I decided to add in a few small adjustments and additional Easter Eggs. And
  then something went very wrong and I basically had to redo the process all over
  again. Learning!
  .
  This is a 5 minute gimmicky prototype. There isn't a ton to do here, as it's
  more about the novelty of seeing these pixel graphics converted to voxel and
  presented as if you were actually there in GB Land. There's a few oversized
  props you can play with, and maybe an easter egg or two, if you poke around.
  .
  There are two versions available. One was built for PC VR hardware, the other
  built specifically for Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest 2 (and can run untethered).
  You'll need to sideload the APK for the Quest and Quest 2, but there's an easy-
  to-follow tutorial linked in the included Readme if you've never done that
  before.
  .
  [Controls:]
  .
  Point your blocky mitts at something that interests you. If it's interactive,
  the small dark green beams will switch to light green. You can grab objects from
  anywhere those beams can point at by pressing the trigger button, so don't worry
  about things being out of reach. Anything in your hands can be rotated by
  tilting the analog sticks Left or Right, and moved closer or further away from
  you by tilting those sticks Back or Forward. You can teleport around the lobby
  and hallway by pointing the mini voxel foxel at your desired floor location and
  pressing the trigger button.
  .
  There's no in-game menu, so on PC if you want to Reset the Scene, hit "R" on
  your keyboard. If you want to close the game, use your VR overlay's Close
  Software function, or tap "Esc" on your keyboard. If you can't do either of
  these things, I'm sorry but I've accidentally trapped you in blocky greenscale
  virtual reality. I promised myself I'd stop doing this...
  .
  [Supporters:]
  .
  I want to thank my Patrons and other Awesome and Amazing Supporters who make
  this stuff possible, including:
  .

  Jessica Bumpus, MaskRider, Matt Schock, and braedon benson

  And thank you to everyone who contributed to the itch.io Bundle for Racial
  Justice and Equality!

  Explore the expansive region of Thebryll, a place filled with many dangers and

  find the six fragments of the Eternity Rune before it's too late!
  .
  The Story
  .
  Long ago, the wizard Odu created two magical runes to balance the natural forces
  of good and evil in the universe. They became known as the Runes of Eternity and
  Destruction, and were sealed away after Odu's passing.
  .
  Eventually, another wizard named Drodu stole the Rune of Destruction from its
  resting place. He was promised strange new powers by the rune, and it corrupted
  him. The Eternity Rune was broken into six pieces and scattered throughout
  Thebryll, leaving the now corrupted Drodu to go into hiding to master his
  newfound powers, confident he could not be stopped.
  .
  Odu arose from his grave, and knowing that the world could meet its doom, looked
  for someone to send on a mission to recover the pieces of the Eternity Rune. He
  eventually found Aloe, a warrior from the forest. Aloe was dubbed the title of
  "Rune Seeker" and was sent on his journey to reassemble the Rune of Eternity and
  save Thebryll.

  IT'S STORYTIME
  .
  There was a time when The Agent was one of the most ass-kickingest special
  operatives on the block. Now, he's just your reclusive grandfather who doesn't
  give anyone the time of day - or didn't, until now. After granddad opens up to
  your mother again following years of solitude, you find yourself standing in
  front of his manor one rainy day for a weekend visit.
  .
  What follows is a tense, action-packed adventure spanning the various decades of
  The Agent's career. Acid-washed maniacs, a hulking mute with a gatling gun,
  tanks and soldiers and dogs - these only scratch the surface of the roller
  coaster.
  .
  Buckle up, baby: things are gonna get a touch rowdy.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Zero to sixty - experience low-key tension one moment and explosive mayhem the
  next. Be ready for anything.
  .
  Watch your step - You're a normal human! You can only take so much punishment. A
  few bullets and you're toast. Explosions? Forget it! You're dead! Be careful not
  to kill yourself with your own grenades, or accidentally shoot destructible
  objects while you're standing right next to 'em.
  .
  Roll, Gun, Roll! - Don't expect to waltz your way into a crowd of soldiers or
  guards and come out the other side unscathed unless you kick ass - a group of
  enemies will quickly overwhelm you unless you've mastered the art of rollin' and
  gunnin'!
  .
  Reactive environment - Most things explode, to your advantage and also to your
  detriment. So just - be careful, all right?
  .
  Be ready to die - SOS is full of tough bosses. You might wanna scream, and we
  encourage it because screaming is good for you!
  .
  AGENT THROUGH THE YEARS
  .
  Your grandfather's got some wild stories, kiddo! Different objects in his study
  trigger them. Each one features new characters, time periods, and narratives
  from the Agent's decades-long career. SOS launches with two exciting stories:
  .
  (1982) MIGHT OF THE STEEL HAND: Take down insane whackjob Lt. Fanibhusan and the
  Steel Hand Army before they wreck an unstable region's only hope at peace!
  .
  (1987) SIERRA NEVER: When a leading science lab goes rogue and kidnaps the Order
  of the Green's Dr. Brooke, it's up to Agent to infiltrate the compound and
  rescue her. Rumor has it an old friend is hot on the Agent's trail and seeking
  the good Doctor for his own gains...

  Reviews for The Search
  .
  Jay Is Games - "...as a puzzle game and a solo-venture at that, there is an
  incredible and impressive amount of love and polish in every moment. I was
  surprised, repeatedly, by several clever twists and turns...I could easily and
  gladly exist in The Search's liminality for hours longer, in its lovingly
  designed and beautifully rendered levels, its gorgeous, thoughtful soundtrack,
  and curious, otherworldly atmosphere."
  .
  Doctor's of Gaming - "The game is short, about an hour or two. But it was enough
  to impress me. It knows what it is, and executes that well. Pleasing visuals,
  good music/sound, an intriguing setting/story and fresh puzzles round out this
  surprising little gem."
  .
  GameRaven - "Big experiences can sometimes come in small packages and the time
  that you spend with The Search will be one that you will reflect on for days
  after you step away from it."

  In the near future, thanks to copyright and patent law abuse, all of the gaming

  ambitious genres. Any game development outside of the company became outlawed,
  ending the era of indie games.

  plants or by pushing foes into thorn bushes.

  Introducing the COMPLETE STORY of "Seduce Me", the popular English Dating Sim
  where you get to tell your story with a family of five demon brothers from the
  moment you meet the incubi to the day you say I do to your favorite incubus.
  This Complete Story includes "Seduce Me The Otome", "Seduce Me 2: The Demon
  War", 13 mini-episodes, and both Audio Otome CDs as well as a basic compendium
  for lore comprehension!
  .
  "It seemed like the start of something new. Something that would change."
  .
  You are a senior in high school along with your two best friends, Naomi
  Patterson and Suzu Cappini. You are also the granddaughter of Harold Anderson,
  the CEO and founder of Anderson Toys, a toy company sworn to give children
  amazing products and give a large part of their profit to charity.
  .
  One day, you get called home to attend your grandfather's funeral. After the
  funeral, you learn that you have inherited his large estate. Your father
  suggests you move in immediately, so the next day, you move out of your parents
  home and into your estate.
  .
  When you enter your new home, however, you see five injured, yet very handsome
  men on the lobby floor. They eventually awaken and make it known that they were
  attacked by a group of dangerous 'misfits' and ran to find shelter, passing out
  as soon as they entered your home.
  .
  You find out that they are incubi, 'demons who consume and use sexual energy of
  humans to survive'. With nowhere to go and a target on their backs, they ponder
  what what to do. Out of sympathy, you offer your home as refuge for a while in
  exchange for minor servitude (it is a big house, after all). They happily agree.
  .
  What will happen as the incubi get comfy? Why exactly did they come the human
  world? Who are the 'misfits', and will they stop pursuing them so the incubi can
  leave?
  .
  ...Will you WANT them to leave?

  Semblance is a puzzle platformer where your character and the world it inhabits
  is made of playdough. Squish, squash and deform your character and the world to
  solve puzzles in Semblance's soft, bouSemblance asks, what if you could deform

description:
  No jumping. Only falling.
  .
  Serious Scramblers is a fast-paced vertical platformer where you can't jump.
  Descend through a hazardous pit and defeat a massive monster lurking in the deep
  in this small but unabashedly tough game!
  .
  Fall your way through the super intense arcade action
  .
  Randomized level generation
  .
  Test your skills on challenging obstacles
  .
  Unlock new characters - each with game changing abilities
  .
  Get ready for the finale - MASSIVE BOSS FIGHT
  .
  Enjoy with some real sweet chip-tune music while playing the game
  .
  Serious Scramblers features a colorful cast of unlock-able characters, each
  changing the game in significant ways. Here are some examples:
  .
  Motoko - Time jumper
  .
  Like a certain innovative FPS, time only moves when Motoko moves. There is a
  catch however, the level scrolls a lot faster when time isn't paused - so,
  unless you want to get skewered by the ceiling spikes, you'll have to make each
  move carefully!
  .
  Silhouette - Gotta go fast
  .
  Silhouette moves at top speed at all times, so avoiding spike traps is as easy
  as A, B, and C! However, the trade-off is that there will be significantly
  lesser gold coins to collect.
  .
  Mummy - Gold Grabber
  .
  Fancy getting more coins to unlock more characters? Mummy's the one to choose.
  It's worth noting that Mummy is one of the slowest characters though!

  The story behind Shell Out Showdown
  .
  Shell Out Showdown is part of what has retroactively been termed the "molasses
  jam" run by the Bay Area Dev Collective. The theme of the jam was to make a
  violent genre non-violent. I picked the last-person-standing, battle-royale
  genre, as it tends to be dominated by violent games, and Shell Out Showdown
  eventually came to life!

  Everything is alive, but how do you talk to it?
  .
  Shrug Island - The Meeting is a warmly wistful adventure, an open door into a
  playful celebration of music, mystery and nature's dances.  In a personal fusion
  of genres crafted by a small team of music and nature lovers, it's a game about
  hope, reconnecting friendship, and hidden pasts, featuring beautiful hand-drawn
  art and soundscapes.
  .
  The Watcher, keeper of the Island's balance, is losing their powers and calls
  for help. Delve into the adventure with two separated Shrug friends, Li and
  Shri, as they heed the call, exploring their shape-shifting musical landscape
  they've just returned to. Using their power to transform the land, by playing
  music or revealing a hidden layer of the world where forgotten things lie,
  combine their skills on a journey towards each other.
  .
  Key Character features:
  .
  - Psychic archeology
  .
  - Musical metamorphosis
  .
  Come away and spend an hour or two with the Shrugs on their lively home. Unravel
  riddles of groaning cliffs and puzzles of the past, where crispy crabs, sweeps
  of seaweed, flights of fish and more mysteries of Shrug time await your voice to
  speak.
  .
  Shrug Island - The Meeting can be played by a goal oriented adventure gamer in
  around an hour. Wanderers can take a more leisurely path and explore the
  changing season around the Island.
  .
  Shrug Island is an allegory on the many levels of identity, belonging, care and
  renewal.
  .
  "The lovely interplay between island, music, and the two playable shrugs was a
  ray of sunlight that I quite enjoyed basking in while it lasted.." - Merlina
  McGovern, Adventure Gamers
  .
  "Shrug Island - The Meeting draws the player into its colorful world, then lets
  them free to see what music can do in this enchanted place. While it can be
  finished quickly, it's well worth your while to lose yourself in its sights and
  sounds ." - Joel Couture, indiegames.com
  .
  "Shrug Island is a relaxing spiritual experience transmitting positive feelings:
  beauty, love, friendship, empathy, harmony with nature, childhood nostalgia." -
  Video Games Art
  .
  Shrug Island - The Meeting is a first commercially released  game based on an
  awarded animation film by Alina Constantin . Followed by many migrations,
  strawbale building, prototypes, a Kickstarter campaign, cultural grants and
  changing tides, you can look into the long gestation process on

  Fight yourself. Die Trying.

  == Both of our FREE content updates - SHUTDOWN and SHUT UP - are now live! ==
  .
  == Play the free demo HERE ==
  .
  SHUT IN is a dark comedy/psychological horror adventure game which explores
  depression and isolation by trapping you inside your own house.
  .
  Your task is simple: Get out of bed, go outside, and get some Fresh Air. Think
  you can handle that?
  .
  Oh, but it might not be quite that simple. Your house isn't looking quite like
  it used to. You don't recognise any of these photos, everything's gotten dirty
  and disgusting, cracks seem to be opening up everywhere, and you're SURE
  everything didn't used to be so... constantly trying to kill you.
  .
  Maybe it's not worth it. Maybe go back to bed. Try again tomorrow.
  .
  If you do decide to keep going, you'll have to face strange puzzles, bizarre and
  uncomfortable obstacles, and a narrator who is unreliable at best, and downright
  insulting at worst. You'll have to get through your day under a constant barrage
  of judgment, sarcasm, and melancholy. If you can cope with that. Idiot.
  .
  SHUT IN is about tension and discomfort in a familiar environment. Your greatest
  tools are also your worst enemies. Common sense will keep you alive, but it
  might not get you very far. Curiosity can have great rewards, but will probably
  just get you killed.
  .
  But don't worry. When you (inevitably) die - because you fell down the stairs,
  were too stupid to operate an oven properly, got ripped apart by untold
  invisible horror, something like that - you can always just give up. Try again
  tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next day.
  .
  Here's what people have been saying about the game:
  .
  "Tackles the subject of mental health in a really clever way... whilst striking
  the perfect balance with its dark comedy."
  .
  9.2/10 - Full Sync
  .
  "With depth far beyond the initial on-the-surface horror story, this experience
  taps into the evocativeness of a mental health crisis."
  .
  9/10 - Cubed3
  .
  "It's funny. It's darkly funny. It's cruelly funny." Buried Treasure
  .
  "Exploring themes of mental illness has certainly been done in games before, but
  SHUT IN does it exceptionally well."
  .
  4/5 - Adventure Gamers
  .
  "I've never felt more unintentionally *seen* by a video game before."
  HeyPoorPlayer
  .
  Key Features:
  .
  Over a dozen unique ways to die!
  .
  Probably a way to survive!
  .
  Original atmospheric horror soundtrack by composer Luc Wilkinson.
  .
  Everything else done by person/mess Cael O'Sullivan.
  .
  A dangerous house full of original puzzles, and loads of ways to get them wrong!
  .
  A hint system which isn't that helpful, and often insults you!
  .
  Multiple items to experiment with, each with tons of unique interactions that
  solve no puzzles and achieve nothing.
  .
  Option to just stay in bed forever!
  .
  Quite short, so it's over quicker!
  .
  Writing up these features is exhausting...
  .
  Try again tomorrow.

  .
  Signs of the Sojourner is a narrative deck-building game about connecting and
  communicating with others. It breaks away from typical card-battlers by instead
  challenging you to understand different perspectives and navigate social
  situations.
  .
  Your deck is your character, shaped by your experiences and relationships.
  Different decks will lead to different narrative paths as your cards impact your
  ability to communicate with various characters. Rather than building the most
  "powerful" deck, you will have to make decisions about who you want to be in
  this world and how you relate to others.
  .
  Set in a near-future earth-like world, you take over your mother's store after
  her death, traveling to diverse locations in order to acquire goods for the
  shop. This is a world where communities are more insulated, where travel is
  difficult, and where climate change has made life hard, but you'll still
  encounter optimistic stories, compassionate characters, and delightful
  surprises.

  available to you. Currently, Monster and Item data as well as graphics are
  located in a folder called " xData" anyone can access this folder, add new
  monsters or items. Please bear in mind some of the functionality listed in the

  It will be possible to upload your own xData Packages on Desura and Moddb. We're

  Tips and Tricks
  .
  Go easy on the weapons! Their stats and abilities don't stack, so it's a waste
  of precious space. Equip just one or two, and support them with artifacts.
  .
  With multiple weapons equipped (like a sword and a whip, in this example), use
  the number keys to select between them. Only one may be used at a time.
  .
  Kite enemies whenever possible! Attack while they're resting, and step away
  while they're not. You can do this repeatedly against anything slower than
  yourself.
  .
  Mouse over enemies to see their stats. Some have nasty abilities (like poison!)
  that will kill you if you aren't prepared. You can also see their speed and
  remaining HP.
  .
  Throw potions at enemies and bosses! A well-placed debuff like slowness or
  confusion can make difficult battles easy.
  .
  Your own effects can be viewed at the bottom right. Note that you cannot stack
  the same effect more than once at a time, so drinking two regeneration potions
  in a row is unhelpful.

developer: The Bonsai Treehouse
publisher: The Bonsai Treehouse
genre: Racing
description:
  (Oct-10-2019) - UPDATE 1.0.0.1:
  .
  Dramatically decreased popping volume of small blue score balloons
  .
  Regressed control time bug in which players could regain time faster by
  repetitively pushing the left stick in any direction over and over.
  .
  Added additional details and names to the credits text document file.
  .
  Summary:
  .
  No control? No worries!
  .
  Ride inside one of 50 inflatable tubes that stick and ride together as one on
  contact all the way to the bottom of one tall mountain through multiple winding
  routes and areas! Pop as many balloons as possible to gain the most points as
  you race to the bottom! Playable with up to four players via local splitscreen,
  Snowdown boasts a casual pick-up-and-play focus with a low barrier to entry!
  .
  Remember: the only way is down!
  .
  Instructions:
  .
  Players each have a yellow Control Timer on their screen that slowly replenishes
  by itself when they aren't moving around. The higher the timer gets, the more
  control they can exert over their inflatable tube. However, when they start to
  move around, the timer will start to tick down to zero at which point they won't
  be able to move at all for a certain amount of time.
  .
  Riding through a Time Gate will grant more control time back for players who are
  able to reach it ahead of others and riding through yellow Hazard Rings will set
  a trap in one of the 36 different zones for other tubes currently riding through
  it! Players then get to watch the event play out in real time on a giant screen
  as the trapped tubes are scrambled in the chaos!
  .
  Inspired by rollercoaster action chase films, classic arcade titles of the 1990s
  and modern Battle Royale games, Snowdown is designed to exhibit a more "chilled-
  out" approach to traditional concepts of game flow, complimenting an idle brand
  of party atmosphere, allowing players the freedom to step back and let a session
  play out by itself and return later on or even let someone else take over if
  they so choose.
  .
  So hop in and crash, bash and slide your way into the biggest racing mosh ten
  thousand feet above! Hold on tight...now let go!
  .

  Social Justice Warriors is a game about the dismissive labels people use to
  silence each other, including "social justice warrior" and "troll". No matter
  what social values you have, attacking and ridiculing other people not only
  fails to achieve progress but has an additional effect of escalating the
  conflict and wearing you down in the process.

  About this game
  .
  The beloved Flash RPG series played by millions lives again in an all-new
  adventure that's not a sequel or a simple remake. When Sonny returns from the
  dead without his memories, he finds himself caught between the conflict of a
  seemingly endless horde of mutated monstrosities and a mysterious paramilitary
  force. With the help of some unlikely allies, he will discover his destiny is
  greater than he expected, and maybe save the world.
  .
  Sonny is a challenging turn-based, combat-focused RPG where unlocking and
  combining the effects of new skills and abilities is required to topple foes
  with an enormous amount of power. Sonny is designed for cunning and creativity
  with an emphasis on strategy and difficulty as the gameplay evolves. Featuring
  stunning artwork by Jet Kimchrea and an engrossing original score by David Orr.
  .
  Engaging, mysterious storyline full of secrets, conspiracies, and zombies.
  .
  Combat-focused gameplay with an intuitive interface.
  .
  Battles with an emphasis on strategy... think your way through it, don't grind.
  .
  Intriguing party members with their own unique abilities.

developer: Undead Avian Publishing
publisher: Undead Avian Publishing
genre: Role Playing
description:
  When Sorbetta loses almost everything in a game of Blackjack, she realizes she
  has a serious gambling problem. Thankfully she was able to get help for her
  gambling addiction and also borrow what she needed to pay off her debts from her
  cousin. However, was this loan divine providence, or a deal with the devil? Join
  Sorbetta as she tries to not only earn the money (plus interest) to pay back her
  cousin, but also find four fantastical treasures that will ensure Sorbetta is
  never bothered by Sherberta again.
  .
  It's not as if the treasures are just garbage, and Sorbetta is probably wasting
  her time, right?
  .
  ...Right?!
  .
  Sorbetta
  .
  The protagonist of this lovely story. A necromancer by trade, she practices when
  she is able using all manner of bodies, both human and otherwise, to hone her
  skills. Unfortunately, she developed a fondness for Blackjack. A big fondness.
  Some bad decisions and a couple thousand gold later, she is now trying her best
  to pay off her over-bearing and bossy cousin.
  .
  Sherberta
  .
  Also a necromancer, like her cousin, however she specializes more with
  incorporeal beings rather than flesh and blood bodies. Self-serving, and ever
  the opportunist, she saw a perfect chance to profit off her cousin's
  little...problem. Even though she can be quite demanding and even a bit bullish,
  there does beat a heart of gold somewhere in that blue bombshell. Or, more
  likely, a heart that beats for gold.
  .
  When it comes to the color of their skin and the outlandish attire they both
  love to wear, neither woman is forthcoming with an explanation. Perhaps some
  things are best left unexplained?
  .
  Key-Anu
  .
  Not much is known about Sorbetta's business associate. The piano mimic spends
  his days in the basement bar, The Dusty Femur, longing for the day he'll get
  brought up to the first floor. Maybe he's just lonesome?
  .
  Raise the dead for fun and profit!
  .
  Multiple (2) endings
  .
  Original comedic script that isn't another JRPG parody or satire
  .
  Several members of the RPG Maker dev community have cameos. See if you can spot
  them all!
  .
  Most of the game development was done live on HawkZombie's Twitch.tv channel
  .
  Made almost entirely from RTP assets, for better or worse!

  This app adds responsive audio feedback to your keystrokes, for a better typing
  experience.
  .
  Choose from 20 different sets of sounds to make your keystrokes have the desired
  audio/emotional impact, including:
  .
  Typewriter/mechanical keyboard sounds for a crisper, more responsive typing
  experience
  .
  Applause or clapping sounds as you type, for motivation and support
  .
  Monstrous growling keystroke sounds to help you express your rage
  .
  Cute squeaking sounds to make you smile
  .
  Melodic or dissonant keystrokes on Marimbas, Vibraphones, or Grand Piano to give
  your typing some atmosphere
  .
  Gory blood-splatter sounds for typing/coding up a massacre
  .
  Firework sounds for celebratory typing
  .
  Burping keystrokes, obviously a core requirement of any typing program
  .
  The app minimizes to the system tray (lower right part of your screen). Click
  the Sound Typist icon in the system tray to change sounds, adjust volume, or
  exit the app.
  .
  Bluetooth Headphone Lag: Most Bluetooth headphones/earbuds have latency/lag that
  may make the keystroke sounds feel less responsive. Depending on your
  sensitivity, this may or may not matter. Recommendation: use wired speakers,
  wired headphones, or low latency bluetooth headphones (with apt-x low latency,
  or "gaming mode").
  .
  Installation Note: You may need to right-click the setup.exe and use the "Run as
  Administrator" option to install. If you are still having issues, try changing
  the "Reputation-based protection" settings in Windows to turn off "Check apps
  and files" and "Potentially unwanted app blocking". This is a random file off
  the internet after all.
  .
  Portable Version: You can now download the portable version that doesn't use an
  installer. Run SoundTypist.exe to start Sound Typist. You can minimize the
  window to the system tray. Keep in mind that if you use the "Start at login"
  option, then it will not work if you move the folder's location.
  .
  Those who are interested in adding their own sounds can search the comments for
  tips on how to do it yourself by modifying the configuration file. It is a
  completely unsupported and undocumented feature, so do not expect me to answer
  any further questions about it.

genre: Adventure;Visual Novel
description:
  The Space Between by Christoph Frey is a surreal short narrative experience in
  three acts about the walls we build for us.
  .
  The architect Martin Melanson, commissioned to build a theater, meets a woman
  named Clara, outside of his apartment complex at night. Attracted to each other,
  they visit the theater's building site.
  .
  While they explore the unfinished stage, surrounded by scaffolds and lost in
  thoughts, reality slowly fades, where the curtain opens and a dark play about
  closeness and separation begins.
  .
  The game's drawn-out, static nature, embedded in blurred PS1 visuals, supports
  its surreal plot and dialogues to create a dreamlike 40 - 50 minute experience,
  that should be played in one sitting.
  .
  Controls:
  .
  W,A,S,D to move
  .
  Mouse to look
  .
  E to interact
  .
  "Overall, these stylistic choices come together in a thoroughly cohesive
  aesthetic whole, amplifying cinematic qualities similar to those of an Ingmar
  Bergman or Nicolas Winding Refn film." RE:BIND
  .
  "The Space Between is deliriously uneasy in its final moments, thanks, in large
  part, to a skin-crawlingly stellar score." Wireframe
  .
  "The Space Between's Martin is afraid of intimacy, which is a lot like being
  terrified of death. Fearing intimacy is almost always about fearing loss." Wired
  .
  There is an excellent three part dissection of The Space Betwee written by
  @cathroon for RE:BIND, which I highly recommend you to read AFTER playing it.

  About
  .
  Spa Taxi ("Spa" is the German word for "fun") is a remake/clone of the original
  Space Taxi, where you need to bring passengers from one pad to another in mostly
  weird unnatural environments.
  .
  The gameplay
  .
  The 40 levels of Spa Taxi offer a variation of challenges:
  .
  Quick reactions
  .
  Avoid rockets and lasers or pass through moving gaps.
  .
  Puzzles
  .
  Push the right buttons, find the shortest path or utilize teleporters.
  .
  Learning
  .
  Memorize the passengers and their destinations, find out better (and quicker)
  ways to move, land or get your customers into or out of your car.
  .
  Dexterity
  .
  Use the right amount of thrust to be fast, but not crash into stuff and quickly
  know which thruster to use while flying upside down in veteran mode.
  .
  Requirements
  .
  Spa Taxi can be played with the keyboard, but is best played with a controller
  (currently only the XBox controller is supported, but others will follow).
  .
  It is looking best in a 16:9ish resolution at FullHD or above, preferring a
  multiple of it (e.g. 1920x1080, 1920x1200, 3840x2160).
  .
  Please check out the demo for Mac and Linux before buying to see if it runs on
  your machine, thank you!
  .
  Play the demo!
  .
  The demo contains 6 levels (plus tutorial) and is a great way to check out the
  gameplay, controller support and performance on your machine.
  .
  It also has a separate highscore list, so you can even compete with your friends
  here. :)
  .
  New and old
  .
  This version of the game takes the original concept and adds or changes a lot of
  things to get a whole new experience while retaining some of the retro feeling.
  .
  Rotation
  .
  The taxi can now rotate to get through narrow passages, avoid obstacles or even
  land on the ceiling.
  .
  Different types of passengers
  .
  There are those that fancy to loop the loop and go fast, but there are also
  those who will reveal their last meal if you rotate too much.
  .
  Health instead of lifes
  .
  The car has health (or integrity) and you can repair it while parking at a
  repair station (which costs money) or by having a mechanic on board.
  .
  When there is nothing left to repair, you  can buy a new car if you have enough
  money.

  You don't know who you are, or how you got here. There's no explanation for any
  of this.
  .
  There's only one thing you can do. Endure the challenges that get thrown in your
  way, learn them as best as you can and find a way to escape from this eternal
  punishment.
  .
  Fight. Not to save the world, but to maybe save yourself.
  .
  An endless stream of challenges
  .
  Splinter Zone creates an infinite chain of levels for you to traverse and test
  your skills in.
  .
  Reliable Randomness
  .
  Splinter Zone doesn't feature a true random level generation. Instead, its
  levels are pre-constructed, but the order in which they appear is randomly
  generated. This way it is still possible for you to get familiar with the game's
  challenges while still having a unique experience every time you play.
  .
  Permission to cheat
  .
  Splinter Zone is a challenging game, but sometimes you may want to have a more
  relaxed experience. For those moments, Splinter Zone features a handy array of
  cheats that you can enable right at the start of the game. You can even turn off
  all enemies in the game, if you so desire...
  .
  Secrets
  .
  I can't talk about those...

  TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT: Be sure to give it a try before you buy it. We want
  you to enjoy the game but only if you're sure that STARDROP is your kind of
  game.
  .
  STARDROP is a single-player first-person video game where you take on the role
  of a Salvage & Rescue Operative named Aryn Vance. With her partner, John
  Kindley, at her side, the two embark on a journey full of mystery and suspense
  with some laughs along the way. STARDROP tells a genuine heart-felt story about
  a long lost starship, its crew and one individual in particular.
  .
  STARDROP presents its narrative through traditional cut scenes and in-game
  cinematic story telling as you play. The main campaign is where the heart of the
  game's narrative lies but you will also be able to experience the universe of
  STARDROP through its side missions.
  .
  Exploration lies at the game's core but so does accessibility. While the game
  offers puzzles and asks the player to figure out what to do or where to go next,
  the flow of information within the game will always guide you. Objectives are
  always made clear and designed with logic in mind. However, those who venture
  off the beaten path will find that there are more than enough secrets to be
  discovered.
  .
  Throughout the game the player will be able to interact with various types of
  interfaces such as control panels, elevators and security systems as well as
  other various interactive objects such as computer interfaces where you can read
  emails, listen to audio logs and more.
  .
  Your All-Purpose-Design (APD) space suit is equipped with a set of tools that
  you will need in order to succeed. The suit comes with a built-in flashlight.
  The object scanner enables you to identify objects of interest that you can
  interact with and it's also capable of zero gravity mobility under certain
  circumstances.
  .
  The DataPad is an essential tool. It enables you to view your current objective,
  read audio and text logs that you've collected and it also comes with a built-in
  mini-map.
  .
  Our main focus will always be on the game's story but we strife to deliver
  breathtaking visuals where possible. Our efforts have lead us to win Best 3D
  Graphics in the Intel Level Up Contest of 2017. We will continue to uphold these

game: Starlight Shores (USA)

developer: Delphinium Interactive
publisher: Delphinium Interactive
genre: Visual Novel
description:
  Starlight Shores launched on October 30th, 2020!
  .
  The Story:
  .
  After your childhood friend Theo wins a weekend getaway to the town of Seaside,
  you prepare to spend your birthday in paradise. It's been months since you last
  saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together.
  .
  She invites her roommate Lena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation
  to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just
  the get-together that you need to reconnect.
  .
  Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on
  driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's
  ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he's bringing
  along an uninvited guest.
  .
  Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's
  about the only thing you share in common...
  .
  Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?
  .
  The Cast:
  .
  Theo
  .
  Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a
  great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to
  have a tight-knit group and doesn't open up to just anyone. She studies
  photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time
  with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is
  your host for the weekend.
  .
  Lena
  .
  Lena is Theo's roommate... and replacement best friend. You don't know much
  about her, or even what she's studying. From what you've seen on Friendex, Lena
  is a vibrant and outgoing person. She's always dyeing her hair different colours
  and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she
  enjoys hiking and playing piano.
  .
  Alec
  .
  Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both
  have similar hobbies like gaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally,
  renting a student house with Alec seemed like a great idea... until he started
  dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining
  that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to
  the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been pissing you off.
  .
  Erika
  .
  A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You don't remember
  much about her, or ever talking to her...

developer: Eric Juvi
publisher: Eric Juvi
genre: Adventure
description:
  A giant cathedral of flesh has appeared in the middle of the ocean on a dying
  world. A small group of scientists are secretly investigating it when a
  mysterious woman appears, facing an impossible task.
  .
  Stars Die is a nonlinear real time scifi mystery game with branching dialogues.
  .
  FEATURES
  .
  Completely nonlinear story. Have long debates with people or ignore them the
  entire game.
  .
  Five parallel, but interconnected story lines, each with its own completely
  separate ending.
  .
  The player isn't at the center of the narrative. Each character has their own
  agenda and they will try to act accordingly in real time, with or without you.
  .
  You can take your time to explore the environments freely, but you might miss
  events and conversations if you take too long.
  .
  The choices aren't about moral dilemmas, but ideological ones. It's all about
  your personal perspective on the events and what you believe in.
  .
  Dark industrial soundtrack by composer Connor ORT Linning.
  .
  ADDED IN 1.2 UPDATE
  .
  Steam Key included
  .

game: Starseed Pilgrim (USA)

developer: droqen
publisher: droqen
genre: Adventure
description:
  "Starseed Pilgrim is a game about tending a symphonic garden, exploring space,
  and embracing fate."
  .
  You are a gardener, tending to empty noise and empty space to fill them both
  with colour. You are a refugee, building your own world away from the spreading
  darkness. You are an explorer, discovering new places, new rules, and new
  fascinations. The universe is bigger than you know.
  .
  ~
  .
  I really don't like describing Starseed Pilgrim! But if I don't, I'm pretty much
  asking you to buy it based on... images, and that's worse. It's a game about
  discovery and learning, and eventually about mastery of a strange set of tools.
  It's been said, and echoed, that it's a game you have to experience for
  yourself.
  .
  I guess I believe that. :)

game: String Tyrant (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/S/String Tyrant (USA)/String Tyrant (USA).json
developer: Starlight Studios
publisher: Starlight Studios
genre: Survival
description:
  A strange deck of playing cards.
  .
  A stranger appearing from a sudden storm.
  .
  The sheltering doorway of a lonely manor.
  .
  Unliving dolls smiling emptily as they chase you down.
  .
  They just want you to join them. Forever.
  .
  String Tyrant is a survival horror game where you must look, think, hide, and if
  necessary, fight your way out of a mysterious mansion filled with monsters and
  traps.
  .
  If you're defeated by a monster or fall for a trap, you'll be ensnared by the
  manor's residents - and join them to hunt your former friends. At least you'll
  be a pretty doll.
  .
  The game has an active card-based combat system where you build combos using
  your magical cards. You can hear nearby enemies through doors and walls, can
  open and close doors to try to break line-of-sight, and must contend with traps
  that will tax your wits. You'll need to unlock the secrets of the manor to stand
  a real chance of escape.
  .
  A free demo is provided. Please ensure system compatibility with the demo before
  purchasing the full game.
  .
  The demo covers the first "phase" of the game, featuring one enemy types, three
  doll types, and two endings. The full game contains more enemy types, traps,
  environmental hazards, new equipment, and the rest of the game's story.
  .
  Version 1.07 (June 14th, 2020)
  .
  This version fixes several bugs and adds the HD art pack as a free downloadable
  to anyone who owns the game. The art pack contains some of the sketches used to
  make the game and some unused assets.
  .
  Version 1.03 (April 22nd, 2020)
  .
  The OSX build has been split into its own version for both the demo and full
  game.
  .
  The Linux build has been discontinued as it is not cross-compatible with any
  other Linux versions. Version 1.02a will remain available for download for any
  Linux users who happen to be running Mint.
  .
  If you are a Linux user and would like to play the game, a guide has been
  written here by friendly user Bicobus. The guide is slightly outdated - the
  engine repository is here. You will need to compile the game for your distro,
  but the process is relatively painless.
  .
  The OSX version was compiled on OSX 10.14.6 Mojave. As above, please contact the
  team if you wish to compile the engine on another version.

  Divide the world

  Make your way through over 50 levels by manipulating a line that divides the
  world. Reveal a platform to get across a gap. Cut through a platform to drop

  Use your power to venture deeper and deeper underground, through forests, caves,
  and a mysterious laboratory. Something is compelling you, but what? Why are

  than quick reflexes and fast reaction time.

description:
  Prisoner 134. You have been purchased for testing and are now the property of
  BioMass Labs. Knowing nothing of the place you have been brought to, your only
  option is to enter the maze and solve the puzzles in the experiment.
  .
  In 2194 humanity has populated the entire galaxy. As our existence expanded,
  crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a
  result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue
  bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law
  enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply
  wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run
  prison systems took form.
  .
  Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is common place. A blind
  trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing every
  day people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive
  divide between the idea of prisoner and person. Hundreds of commercial prisons
  and law enforcement companies thrive.
  .
  Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an
  auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal
  ramifications.
  .
  Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are
  being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is
  known about the details of the study.
  .
  You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for
  law enforcement to release you to the company.
  .
  The subject is a sci-fi horror puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic
  puzzle adventure games with horror elements.
  .
  You will need to learn to navigate the complex to find your way to the various
  puzzles set out in the experiment and discover the reason behind the testing.
  .
  You are being monitored by those running the tests and are required to visit a
  bio-data terminal periodically to record your vital signs and other data for
  record keeping. If you fail to do so, you will be removed from testing by
  euthanization.

  But be careful-with every move, the dirt becomes more unstable. One wrong step
  could lead to a fatal cave-in.

game: Sunset (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/S/Sunset (USA)/Sunset (USA).json
developer: Tale of Tales
publisher: Tale of Tales
genre: Adventure
description:
  It's 1972 and a military coup has rocked Anchuria, a small country in Latin
  America. As a result, you, Angela Burnes, US citizen, are trapped in the
  metropolitan capital of San Bavn. Your paradise has turned into a warzone. To
  make ends meet, you take up a job as a housekeeper. Every week, an hour before
  sunset, you clean the swanky bachelor pad of the wealthy Gabriel Ortega. You are
  given a number of tasks to do, but the temptation to go through his stuff is
  irresistible. And what is he up to? As you get to know your mysterious absent
  employer better, you are sucked into a rebellious plot against the notorious
  dictator who rules the country with an iron fist.
  .
  Sunset is a narrative-driven first-person exploration game that centers on the
  discovery of clues to a story that takes place as you play.
  .
  Sunset is in part inspired by action games set in a war-like context, like many
  first-person shooters. What life would be like for the NPCs in such games? How
  does it feel when war is the backdrop for your day-to-day life?
  .
  How the game is played
  .
  Sunset is divided into 44 play sessions that each take a fictional hour: until
  the sun sets. Each time you get a list of tasks that you are requested to do.
  But there is more to do in the apartment than just work. There are other
  activities, such as going through the owner's possessions in search of
  information, and interacting with his 1970s-era technological gadgets.
  .
  The Story of Sunset
  .
  Angela Burnes, is not an empty vessel. She has a personality of her own and you
  discover her thoughts while playing. As a US citizen at the end of the sixties,
  she is inspired by the Black Power and civil rights movements. In an effort to
  learn more about egality, she travels to the then socialist republic of
  Anchuria. During her visit, a US-backed military coup happens and she is
  disallowed from leaving the country. Her university degree is not recognized by
  the new regime and she is forced to work as a housekeeper to sustain herself.
  .
  Angela's younger brother, David, who had followed her to Anchuria ends up
  joining an underground resistance movement. And Angela must worry about what
  happens to him when the war begins in earnest.
  .
  Gabriel Ortega is a lover of the arts. Through his work as a curator he met
  Maria Luisa of the wealthy Veleta family. Thanks to the money from their
  families, Gabriel became a much celebrated benefactor of the arts. When the coup
  happened, theaters and museums were closed. The new government offered affluent
  citizens safety and positions of power. Gabriel's wife, and most of her family
  and their friends, were happy to accept but Gabriel refused. Rising tensions
  between the couple ultimately lead to a separation.
  .
  The story of Sunset begins when Gabriel Ortega moves into a new penthouse
  apartment in the capital city of San Bavn. It is in this apartment that Angela
  Burnes finds employment.
  .
  "Sunset uses the routine of labour to exquisite effect as a framework to tell a
  story about class and political revolution." - Simon Parkin, Eurogamer
  .
  "Sunset acts as a thoughtful, pensive walk through social themes and struggles
  not often explored in this medium." - Game Spot, Josiah Renaudin
  .
  "Sunset is a wonderfully atmospheric slow burner and a valuable addition to a
  medium where the predominant approach to conflict is to just give you a big old
  gun and invite you to get stuck in." - Philippa Warr, Rock Paper Shotgun
  .
  "The story is excellent and will draw you in, making you feel as if you truly
  are Angela Burnes." - Jessica Mock, Hardcore Gamer
  .
  "Rather than focus on the explicit violence of a military coup, Sunset centers
  on the emotional brutality of war." - Reid McCarter, Playboy Magazine

  Super Rad Raygun Overview
  .
  It is the year 198X. Big hair is hot, and the war with the Soviets is colder
  than a refreshing glass of New Coke. RAD RAYGUN must travel the world fighting
  communist robots, and save the 1980s by shooting his way through the decade in a
  totally fresh, expanded version of the original XBLIG game.
  .
  SUPER RAD RAYGUN pits Rad against a whole new wave of deadly enemies and
  locations - from the Communist strongholds of the Far East to strategically
  insignificant islands off the South American coast. But chill out, because Rad
  has gnarly new weapons, upgrades, and a revamped gameplay engine to help him
  out.
  .
  Ultra sharp 144p resolution graphics and 4 unique shades of monochrome off-green
  bring Rad Raygun to life, as only 80s mobile technology can.
  .
  Super Rad Raygun is a nod to video games and pop culture of the 1980s and pokes
  fun at the politics of that era. It is a trip down memory lane for retro
  enthusiasts, while also incorporating modern systems and play mechanics familiar
  to today's gamer.
  .
  About
  .
  Super Rad Raygun is a follow-up to the Xbox Live Indie Game, Rad Raygun. Led by
  Ronald Reagan and Dr. Yokoi (Dr. Y), Rad Raygun must save the 1980s from
  communist robots! While the original Rad Raygun had only five levels and limited
  upgrades, Super Rad Raygun includes over twenty levels, 3 modes of play, a new
  upgrade system, and a limited-energy mechanic.
  .
  As a play portable gaming's limited battery life, Super Rad has a limited amount
  of energy to perform certain abilities, such as jumping, shooting, and dashing.
  When Rad depletes his energy, he must rest for a few seconds.
  .
  Throughout the game, Rad collects "bits" - these are a form a currency used to
  buy upgrades from Dr. Y. As Rad becomes more and more powerful, he consumes more
  and more energy, but thankfully Rad can upgrade his battery life (amount of
  energy) and his agility (time it takes to recover).
  .
  DRM-Free!
  .
  Thanks to itch.io, we're bringing you Super Rad Raygun DRM-free for the first
  time ever!  This build does not require Steam and does not feature Achievements

  trains at Country Slime Station. Enjoy handmade 16-bit pixel art backgrounds and

  use, or how many controllers you can use. The game supports as many players as
  you have controllers for, both local and online!

  classics, Super Slime Arena seeks to capture the unique joy of playing together

  Story
  .
  Embark on a journey through your last years of high school and beyond as you try
  to find success, love, and yourself.
  .
  Aya Mizuki is a pretty typical teenager - cynical, lazy, and doesn't know what
  she wants to do with her life. As she finds she has a passion for volleyball,
  your choices will help guide her to passion in her love life as well.
  .
  Things don't always end on a high note... but sometimes, that's just how life
  is.
  .
  Characters
  .
  Aya Mizuki is a quiet, but lazy girl. She's not very social, and tends to spend
  most of her time with her nose in a book. She spends some of her evenings
  warming the bench for the school's volleyball team, as having club activities
  always looks good on a college resume. After a tragic accident injures one of
  the team's star players, Aya is called upon to step in, and with her Grandpa's
  help, finds a passion for volleyball that extends past her senior year in high
  school as she pursues a career.
  .
  Nanami Ebihara is the volleyball team captain, and hates the fact that Aya isn't
  taking things seriously. Quiet, shy and unassuming, Nanami is far from a typical
  high school sports star, instead she dedicates her life to her craft.
  .
  Yuka Saito is one of the most popular girls in school, pretty and with a sharp
  sense of humour she's the life of the party, so to speak. She flirts with and
  befriends Aya, introducing her to the local bar scene.
  .
  Eri Toyama is one of Nanami's oldest friends, and joins the volleyball team
  after meeting Aya. She looks up to Aya as a big sister, and though she has a lot
  of problems in her home life, she's always optimistic, cheery and cute.
  .
  Yuichi Hiyama is the star of the school's soccer team and is tipped for great
  things in the future. Yuichi and Aya become fast friends over their shared love
  of beef bowls. However as tryout season approaches, Yuichi comes to Aya with an
  offer she may not be able to pass up...
  .
  Aya's grandpa Satoshi lives in the countryside and takes care of Aya in the
  summer. Satoshi had an oddball sense of humour, an equally oddball laugh and
  loves his family very much. Maybe it's all the tea he drinks. What Aya doesn't
  know is that he was once an athlete too.
  .
  Features
  .

  Partial voice acting and a 100,000 word script featuring multiple routes.

  Once upon a time
  .
  There was a prince on a mission to save a princess from the hands of a
  terrifying dragon.
  .
  This prince, however, wasn't very brave, so his father ordered a witch to
  enchant a sword.

  This magical sword had a will of its own and was, unlike the prince, brave and
  wise.
  .
  Together they embarked on an adventure of a lifetime.
  .
  A fairytale with a twist!

  You control the sword with your mouse by moving it around. The prince will
  follow the sword, unless he is scared. Which happens more often than not.
  Because the prince is afraid of a lot of things. His fears include spikes,
  birds, green blobs, moles, heights, first dates, germs, fire and of course
  dragons!
  .
  By holding the right mouse button near the prince you can drag him to safety
  while he shivvers in his armor. You can also spin and swing the sword with the
  left mouse button to hit enemies or deflect projectiles.
  .
  What can you expect from this game?

  * 2 hours of gameplay!

genre: Adventure
description:
  Tacoma is a narrative adventure set aboard a high-tech space station in the year
  2088. As you go about your mission, you'll explore every detail of how the
  station's crew lived and worked, finding the clues that add up to a gripping
  story of trust, fear, and resolve in the face of disaster.
  .
  At the heart of Tacoma is the facility's digital surveillance system, which has
  captured 3D recordings of pivotal moments in the crew's life on the station. As
  you explore, echoes of these captured moments surround you. You'll use your
  ability to rewind, fast-forward, and move through the physical space of these
  complex, interwoven scenes to examine events from every angle, reconstructing
  the multi-layered narrative as you explore.
  .
  Tacoma is the next game from the creators of Gone Home, and carries on that
  tradition of detailed, immersive, and powerful storytelling, while pulling
  players deeper into the narrative than ever before.
  .
  A Richly Layered Story Experience
  .
  Six crewmembers lived and worked on space station Tacoma, forming relationships,
  experiencing love and loss, and facing crisis together. Discover not just what
  happened to these people, but what makes them who they are, through your role as
  an interactive investigator. The story is told through a series of fully voiced
  and animated interactive AR scenes, immersing you in the events on Tacoma.
  .
  A Groundbreaking Multi-Path Story System
  .
  In each section of the station, you are surrounded by digital representations of
  crewmembers following their own parallel story threads that diverge, recombine,
  and split off again. Rewind, fast-forward, and move through these scenes'
  chronologies as they swirl around you. Your interactive tools allow you to
  discover the tightly-knotted narrative from every angle, and in every detail.
  .
  A Deeply Interactive Gameworld
  .
  Explore Tacoma Station both physically and digitally. Unlock doors and drawers
  to find meaningful objects, notes, and physical artifacts, while simultaneously
  exploring extensive records of the crew's digital communications and personal
  thoughts. Every facet of the crew's experience on Tacoma is part of your
  investigation.
  .
  A Vision of the Future
  .
  Experience life in the year 2088. Discover a rich fictional universe that
  depicts humanity's expansion into low-Earth orbit and beyond. A deeply-imagined
  speculative vision of the near future from the award-winning story team behind
  Gone Home and BioShock 2: Minerva's Den.
  .
  A Compact Narrative Experience
  .
  Tacoma is estimated to take around 2 to 5 hours to complete. How deep you dig
  and how much detail you find is up to you. Tacoma is a non-combat, non-puzzle-
  focused game. The details of the story and gameworld are there for you to
  discover at your own pace.

genre: Visual Novel;Interactive Fiction
description:
  A small village known as Windy Meadow may not be rich or famous, yet it offers
  something even more valuable: harmony. Gorgeous views, serenity of the forest,
  gentle rivers and fertile land... Even beasts and dragons seem to usually keep
  their distance.
  .
  Nevertheless, not everyone can find peace here. The time has come for three
  young people to decide what are they going to do with their future. And it's
  happening much sooner than they would wish for.
  .
  Will Vena, the best huntress in the village, stay with her family? Is it better
  to take the lucrative job offered by distant merchant guild?
  .
  Fabel wants to become a famous bard, but his rough past complicates so many
  things. Should he follow his dream, or is it finally time to wake up?
  .
  And is Iudicia, the local outsider and talented herbalist, going to marry a man
  she doesn't love? Is spending her future alone and lonely the only alternative?
  .
  Three intertwined stories. For 2,5 hours you get to play as three protagonists
  with their own problems to solve. Each route offers different moods, topics and
  perspectives and all of them share the dramatic, final chapter.
  .
  A multitude of side characters. Their varying personalities and complex
  relationships make this community feel alive and relatable.
  .
  An immersive, detailed village. You get to visit multiple buildings and outdoors
  and see how they change over the course of the game. The carefully thought-out
  fantasy setting reflects through both the dialogues and visuals.
  .
  Choices matter. Choice-shaped endings significantly shift the game's atmosphere,
  while even smaller decisions influence dialogues, events and how your
  protagonists are perceived by other characters.
  .
  Heart-warming scenes. A unique mix of coziness and melancholy supported by
  colorful pixel art and emotional music.
  .
  Animated visuals. Unlike most Visual Novels, Tales From Windy Meadow replaces
  the majority of narration with animated character sprites. More than 99% of the
  in-game text represents dialogues.

  Tales from the Road - Furry Interactive Fiction - Made in Twine
  .
  Tales from the Road is a slice of life interactive fiction game. The game
  features a story about a disgruntled freelance worker who has grown bored of
  their work. Seeking to do something different with their life, they come up with
  the idea to go on an excursion across the country.
  .
  The game is currently in development and still has some time to go until I would
  consider it "finished". Despite this, there's still a decent amount of content
  currently available. With total playtime hovering around 1-3 hours given the
  content that's in-game right now.
  .
  So, what is in the game?
  .
  Currently, the game has 4 fully completed chapters. With the first 3 chapters
  mainly laying the groundwork for the eventual excursion across the country. They
  introduce and develop the core cast of characters, while also providing a bit of
  backstory for the player character.
  .
  Chapter 4, the latest chapter to be completed, marks the actual start of the
  road trip. In which, the main cast of characters head to the first road trip
  stop, Chicago. With Sasha being the main focus of this chapter - most of your
  time will be spent exploring Chicago alongside her.
  .
  The next chapter, 5, is currently being worked on.
  .
  I'm planning for a total of 8 chapters, although chapter 4 and the proceeding
  chapters will be substantially longer than the first 3.
  .
  How is the game played?
  .
  The game is played in your standard Twine environment, which is to say it's
  mostly text-based. At the start, you'll be asked to make your character which
  involves picking a name and race (Wolf, Lion, Fox, or Dragon). From there on
  you'll be able to navigate the world, make choices, and go through dialogue by
  selecting certain inputs. See screenshots for examples.
  .
  Of the main cast of characters, 3 out of the 4 currently have artwork. This
  includes Sasha, Holly, and Valery. I do plan on getting art done for the 4th
  character, Jacob, at some point.
  .
  Speaking of, all artwork was done by the fantastic Kasscabel. Check out her
  Twitter page here or her Fiverr page here.
  .
  What kind of content is in the game?
  .
  This game is mostly safe for work. There is swearing and some things that could
  be considered suggestive. Nothing crazy though.
  .
  Boring stuff
  .
  If you encounter any bugs, feel free to let me know in the comments section.
  Even if you didn't have any problems, I'd appreciate hearing any feedback you
  might have!  Just post it on here via a rating (top right corner) or a comment.
  Helps let me know if I'm doing stuff right.
  .
  Tales from the Road will always be available for free on here. Donations are on
  for the standalone download if that's something you'd be interested in. Welcomed
  but not expected blah blah blah you know how it is.

  Lusting for the latest? Check out Tallowmere 2: Curse of the Kittens.
  .
  Raise your shield. Embrace Lady Tallowmere's dungeons.
  .
  Indulge Lady Tallowmere. See how far through her lovingly violent dungeons you
  can delve in this 2D indie action roguelike-inspired platformer.
  .
  New rooms are procedurally generated every time you play, meaning you'll have to
  be on your guard for every randomly-placed enemy, elite, boss, and treasure
  chest you'll come across.
  .
  Each room gets progressively bigger, harder, and more rewarding the further you
  go.
  .
  The concept is simple yet hard to master:
  .
  Raise your shield to block enemy attacks.
  .
  Lower your shield and strike your foes when the timing is right.
  .
  Jump or move to avoid traps, or raise your shield to reduce damage taken.
  .
  Find the key to advance to the next room.
  .
  Collect weapons, outfits, headgear, and shields of various rarities to aid your
  journey.
  .
  Turn in souls from slain enemies to increase your base stats and passive
  abilities.
  .
  Stay alive as long as you can.
  .
  Brace yourself with your shield as you learn the quirks of each foe and trap so
  you can strive for that "one more run" high-score victory! Each dungeon is
  infinite in length so it's up to you to push your limits; a local scoreboard

  Temple Scramble is a fast-paced, asymmetrical two-player game that pits keyboard

  exploring an ancient temple in search of valuable artifacts. She must run
  through the temple and collect five pieces of treasure, avoiding deadly traps
  along the way. The player at the mouse controls Phulax, a guardian spirit
  protecting the temple's treasure from would-be thieves. He must prevent Indira
  from leaving the temple with the treasure, by shifting around the floor she
  walks on, matching three tiles of the same color to create traps for her.
  .
  Test your wits in three different chambers of the Temple:
  .
  Bridge - If Indira doesn't watch her step, Phulax could whisk away the ground
  beneath her feet, sending her plummeting to the forest below!
  .
  Courtyard - Huge spikes block Indira's path to the treasure. She must move
  quickly, or Phulax may use the spikes to destroy the treasure- or her!
  .
  Crypt - This chamber is full of giant boulders, and Phulax is ready to roll! Can
  Indira dodge all the rolling boulders, or will she be flattened before she can
  escape?

  call home, and granted magic by the friendly spirits of the archipelago, one
  small party of would-be adventurers sets out. Find a way to save the many goblin

  TENNNES is a local multiplayer game by Jan Willem Nijman, with audio by Eirik

  Originally comissioned by NO QUARTER, TENNNES was later included as a gift for
  backers of the SPORTSFRIENDS Kickstarter.
  .
  Once purchased, you're allowed to distribute the game to your friends!
  .
  Here's what people have said about TENNNES:
  .
  It's almost as visually minimalistic as Pong, and it has very simple pick-up-
  and-play controls like Virtua Tennis, but it's tactically much deeper than
  either of those games. --Bennett Foddy
  .
  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gutefabrik/sp...
  .
  What TENNNES has managed, in its simple glory, is a distillation of both the
  instinctive brilliance of tennis and the longer metagame that occurs between
  opponents. -- Nick Dymond
  .
  http://forceofhab.it/blog/tennnes-anyone/
  .
  Instead of being just a refinement of its source material,Tennnes challenges our
  expectations of digital games by presenting a set of mechanics with few
  directions other than its puckish title. -- Charles Pratt

  TENNNES features a brilliant jingle and sound effects by Eirik Suhrke, whose

genre: Visual Novel
description:
  After finding the cursed play 'The King in Yellow', Trixie Glimmer Smith, a
  slacking student at Bluebell University recounts the terrible events that set
  her a week behind in her coursework.
  .
  This story follows on from the events of Parsnip (free download here) with a
  host of new characters and an expanded world, although you can still enjoy it
  without playing Parsnip.
  .
  Trixie is around 3-5 hours long, if you want to play all the content.
  .
  Check out the free demo below!
  .
  Features
  .
  Insight:
  .
  Throughout the game events may start to take their toll on Trixie's mind. As
  Trixie gains insight her narration becomes ever more unreliable.
  .
  Unlike many sanity systems Trixie's insight system is hidden, meaning you never
  know for sure when you are being affected by it.
  .
  This system also means additional playthroughs of the game may vary!
  .
  Can you really trust anything Trixie sees? Can you afford not to?
  .
  Multiple Paths:
  .
  Trixie can choose to spend her week with the Friendly, albeit slightly scary
  shopkeeper Heidi, the excitable baker Gregg or the chill milkwoman Bell.
  .
  At points the three routes may intertwine, giving different perspectives on the
  same story.
  .
  The game also has two main potential endings, with additional minor alternate
  endings.
  .
  A Strange World:
  .
  Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, psychic birds and cosmic gods, Trixie
  explores the rural England inspired Bluefields County and discovers some of the
  horrors that secretly lurk in it's scenic countryside.
  .
  Art Book:
  .
  If you spend $6.99 on Trixie you get an Art book with the game! Exciting stuff!
  It contains all sorts of concept art,  bios and fun trivia about the game, the
  characters and the world.
  .
  Content Warnings:
  .
  Trixie Glimmer Smith contains a few mild descriptions of violence, horror,
  implied sexual content, some exploration of negative trans feelings and some bad
  language.

  Idris is a bonds man- a special bonds man. While most of his clients need to
  bail loved ones out of jail, a few are looking for a reprieve from someone they
  once knew. For Evalise, all she wanted was to get a bail bond for her boyfriend,
  when Idris surprised her with a simple but confusing question.
  .
  What if you could make him forget all about you?
  .
  Evalise's boyfriend has a bit of a wild side... and a bit of a knack for being
  caught. She arrives at a bail bonds place run by a man named Idris- however,
  while working out a bail bond, he springs a question about a different kind of
  bond- a memory bond. With his knife, he's able to sever any ties a person has
  with someone else, permanently, making the other person completely forget about
  his client. With one small cut, she'd be able to leave her not-so-great
  boyfriend behind and move on...

game: There Will Be Ink (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/T/There Will Be Ink (USA)/There Will Be Ink (USA).json
developer: summitfever
publisher: summitfever
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  There Will Be Ink is a difficult tactical action game for 1-8 players. Play solo
  or with friends in battles between stick figure armies on a paper notepad, just
  like you used to draw in class instead of paying attention!
  .
  TWBI is a difficult game, where charging forward into the fray will rarely win a
  battle. Tactical thinking is essential. Assessing the battlefield, taking cover
  as needed, keeping an eye on troops positions: all of these are essential for
  winning the day. Or, if that sounds like a chore, switch to "Arcade Mode" and
  run & gun at will!
  .
  Tactical Depth
  .
  Although the theme and visuals might suggest otherwise, there is a lot of depth
  underlying these doodles. As units gain experience and level up during a battle,
  they become progressively more proficient at battle and will go prone to evade
  danger, hide behind cover when attacking, and dodge incoming rockets. Ranking up
  also increases various other attributes, such as stamina, ammo capacity, weapon
  accuracy, and even how quickly a unit will raise or lower a flag to take over a
  building. Actions such as running, rolling, and throwing grenades take stamina,
  and if a unit's stamina runs out they become exhausted and must wait a short
  period to catch their breath. Outside of battle, the player can use experience
  points earned during battle to unlock unit-specific and global training and
  weapon upgrades as well as HQ abilities like ammo drops, paratroopers, and air
  strikes.
  .
  Mission Variety
  .
  While some missions see you attack the enemy head on, others involve building up
  a base using engineers, rescuing prisoners behind enemy lines using a lone
  sniper, fighting against your own defecting forces, traditional "boss" fights,
  and even battling it out at sea (upcoming). In addition to the built-in campaign
  missions (39 and counting), There Will Be Ink includes a map editor to design
  your own battlefields from scrap as well as a campaign editor to string missions
  together into a full fledged campaign. Or, if you're not feeling creative, be
  sure to check out the "Quick Battle" option, which allows you to choose a few
  variables using sliders and toggles and then jump into a random map.
  .
  Persistent Battlefield
  .
  In There Will Be Ink, the history of any given battle is retained by the
  craters, shells, and red ink spilled on the battlefield, while end-of-battle
  stats are there to give you a more numerical analysis of the battle.
  .
  Play With Friends
  .
  Play with or against up to 7 friends in local multiplayer (or with a few friends
  online using Steam Remote Play Together). A team can play through a whole
  campaign together or just a quick battle or player-designed map. In campaign
  missions that were previously won, players can join the enemy team for an extra
  challenge (or not!). In addition to end-of-battle stats for players to compare,
  badges are presented to players for such feats as the most kills, longest
  streak, most deaths avenged, and many more (including less brag-worthy badges
  like most deaths and most medics killed).
  .
  Game Features:
  .
  Fast-paced action gameplay with a focus on cover
  .
  Take control of any friendly unit on the battlefield
  .
  Play through nearly 40 missions (and counting) across three campaigns
  .
  Jump into a quick battle with the random map generator, with sliders and toggles
  for troops & buildings, trees, debris, and rivers

  infantry, snipers, medics, RPG troops, heavy machine gunners, engineers, laser
  jetpack troops, and flamethrowers, why not!

  action
  .
  Campaign Editor - string missions together into a campaign to play with your
  friends
  .

  .
  Join a battle in progress for 8 player local co-op or vs. gameplay
  .
  Navigate dynamic battlefields by wading across rivers and taking cover behind
  trees, rocks, sandbags, and craters left behind in the chaos
  .

  buildings and trees
  .
  Earn training credits, even when a battle is lost, to assign new abilities to
  your troops
  .

  is greatly appreciated. Purchasing the game grants you access to all future
  builds and includes a Steam key.

  Story:
  .
  Peace is scarce in the country of Aslande, and it has been at war with the
  neighbouring country of Eressia for centuries. When one battle ends, another
  inevitably begins, either months or years later. To Rhea, however, war is a
  distant concept; something she has heard about, but never witnessed. Born in a
  small, secluded village, Rhea occupies her life with more mundane concerns: her
  job at the local hospital, her playful bickering with her friend Asa, and her
  prayers for a successful harvest come autumn.
  .
  However, when Rhea's childhood friend, Luca, returns home to the village after
  fighting in one of Aslande's many wars, Rhea is suddenly faced with a problem.
  Why is Luca suddenly so cold, so distant? What did he see out on the
  battlefield, and how did it change him?
  .
  At the same time, new worries plague Rhea, as one of the patients at the
  hospital is suffering from a rather perplexing illness - and a failure to cure
  him could have some unpleasant outcomes...
  .
  About:
  .
  This World Unknown is a fantasy-themed otome game where the player assumes the
  role of the first person narrator, Rhea, and can romance four available guys.
  Which route you end up on depends on the choices made during the common route.
  .
  The character routes themselves are rather long, and have a lot of plot twists
  and world building (and lots and lots of characters).

  The screen resolution is 1280x720.

  When a dark presence reveals itself it is up to Tabby to get her friends out of
  there alive!
  .
  This story follows on from the events of The Testimony of Trixie Glimmer Smith
  (https://digital-poppy.itch.io/trixie), but should still be enjoyable as a

  choose what she investigates wisely!

  The game stars Tabby, and her friends Trixie and Nikita (the stars of The
  Testimony of Trixie Glimmer Smith). They don't always get on all that well, but

  The game also has a host of side characters hidden in the barrows many ancient

description:
  Toto Temple Deluxe is a fast-paced, local-multiplayer party game in which
  players must steal an egg-laying goat from their friends and try to keep it on
  their own head for as long as possible. You know, normal stuff.
  .
  Dashing Gameplay
  .
  Infinitely dash in any direction to swiftly move around and powerfully headbutt
  the goat carrier to steal its four-legged booty. Escape your jealous opponents
  and protect the goat by blocking their attacks with a well-timed shield pop!
  You'll "get their goat", guaranteed.
  .
  Classic Mode
  .
  Prove you're the ultimate shepherd in Classic mode: Gather 3k points first by
  holding on to the goat, collecting coins hatched from goat eggs (yeah... don't
  ask) and harnessing the power of powerful power-ups! Play as teams or in free-
  for-all.
  .
  Bomb Mode
  .
  Blast everyone's face off in Bomb mode: Be the first to grab the explosive goat
  (we know, stop interrupting us) and keep it long enough for it to detonate near
  your soon-to-be-dead rivals. Lose the goat and the timer resets! Play as teams
  or in free-for-all.
  .
  Temples
  .
  Each temple offers a unique, exploitable mechanic for you to discover. Use them
  wisely and outsmart your opponents like they don't even... what?... how did
  you..?
  .
  Bots
  .
  Bots will play with you whenever you want and for as long as you want. They
  never complain. They also never open up your fridge and ask if they can eat that
  pizza slice you got left from last night. Bots are awesome. Oh, and you can
  change their difficulty level too, because they will probably kick your ass-
  tonishing little bottom.

  Frequently Asked Questions
  .
  Q - So, what this game is about?
  .
  A - Towayami is essentially a horror adventure game.
  .
  I won't spoil too much about its story, but you'll have to explore, find and use
  items, solve puzzles... and survive.
  .
  Oh... and you'll also be immersed in darkness. All the time.
  .
  Q - I got it. It's as if I'm playing through the eyes of a blind person. Do I
  have any visual clues to help me out?
  .
  A - No, you don't. It's pitch black, so you'll have to make use of the four
  other senses available to the main character.
  .
  Mainly touch and sound, but you'll also get to know when something smells or
  tastes "different".
  .
  Anyway, your brain will soon get used to this condition and will start filling
  the gaps by creating visual references where, in fact, there are none.
  .
  Just like when you happen to wander in the dark in real life.
  .
  Q - Do I at least get a tutorial?
  .
  A - During the first part of the game, even if you won't find any "hand in hand"
  guide in it, you'll have all the time and relatively safe areas to learn how to
  play.
  .
  At first you'll be confused about who you are and what you have to do, but just
  by touching and examining your surroundings, you'll soon get enough information
  to understand all the important bits of the story.
  .
  Q - Hey, what's the deal with that black screenshot?
  .
  A - You know, taking meaningful screenshots from a game where the main feature
  is the absence of any graphics... was quite challenging. (_;)
  .
  Q - What was your main inspiration to make this game?
  .
  A - After I made "Five minutes a day", I kept thinking about how that short
  "graphicless" experience could've been expanded into a proper adventure game.
  .
  Coming up with a good story and a smooth gameplay wasn't a quick and easy task,
  so this game became a sort of "secret project" I kept working on in between my
  other releases.
  .
  Obviously, as previously stated in my other works (like with "The hair in the
  wall"), one of my biggest ispirations is Junji Ito and his works.
  .
  Many of his stories resonate really strong with Towayami.
  .
  Q - One last advice?
  .
  A - Only one? I'll give you three: keep your ears open, touch everything, and
  remember to use the "light touch" (right click) to examine things in a safe way.

developer: Essay Games
publisher: Essay Games
genre: Adventure
description:
  The Trolley is a first-person point and click narrative game about the sudden
  closure of a public transportation system in a fictional Rustbelt American city.
  .
  Set in the late 1950s, The Trolley invites players complete tasks in order to
  dismantle an incline railroad of a recently discontinued trolley line. As the
  player boards up the gatehouse, disposes of paperwork, and performs other
  closure duties, they are given a series of inner monolog choices that reflect on
  urban infrastructure, labor, and technological progress.
  .
  The stories, environments, architecture, and scenery are all pulled from
  extensive research Nicholas O'Brien has conducted over the past two years. The
  often untold narratives of the trolley closures from LA to Atlanta, Cincinnati
  to Pittsburgh interweave throughout this game. Using conventions from
  experimental filmmaking, essayistic moving image work, and contemporary story-
  driven indie games, The Trolley ask players to contemplate the ways in which the
  absence of the trolley has reshaped American civic space.

  Introducing Ultimate Zombie Death Ball

  a pure justice system for our post-apocalyptic times. All crimes will be treated
  as equal and will result in a trip to the Zombie Dome.  We are all equal in the

  innocent will survive. Come out and watch the spectacle of our modern justice

  Ultimate Zombie Death Ball is a 1v1 arena sports game set in a zombie
  apocalypse. The object of the game is to get a ball in your opponent's net,
  while being chased by a hoard of hungry zombies. Also, the ball is electrified,
  and will stun you if you kick it. Luckily, the zombies can kick it for you. You
  can get them to do this by having them chase you, or by throwing meat on the
  field for them to chase instead. After 3 minutes play is over, and the winner is
  whoever has more goals.

genre: Survival;Puzzle
description:
  Uno, a newborn lifeform composed of dense steel, buzzy circuits and disjointed,
  static memories, wakes up, looking through a frosted cerulean ceiling. On its
  inside drive, weird images, and a text file with instructions.
  .
  The Subject's test has begun. Meet me at the top of the Obelisk.
  .
  "Where am i?"               "How did i came into existence?"
  "For what purpose?"                   "By the hands of whom?"
  .
  Isolated in a hidden point of our universe, the Obelisk is  a true wonder land,
  far from the 01's chains of morality and ethics. A place of true scientific
  progress and rebellion against the deterministic laws of nature's causality.
  .
  There's no other way. All the answers, reasons and a way out, lies at the top.
  .
  Unobelisk is a solo turn based, exploration game focused on resource management
  and puzzle solving.
  .
  With level design inspired by classic Resident Evil games and Metroidvanias,
  puts the player in the logic circuits of Uno, exploring an obelisk-shaped space
  station for a path to the top of the structure, where a way out is promised.
  .
  The not exactly linear progression of the game is blocked by a number of
  riddles, passwords, keys and the mysterious threat of the primordial ghosts,
  along with your own Subject brothers and even the 4 scientists themselves.
  .
  On the other hand, optional puzzle solving and exploration are rewarded with
  upgrade modules, that grants better ammo capacity, maximum health boost, greater
  evasive perfomance or stronger offensive capabilities.
  .
  Under normal conditions, the game can be finished between 10 and 20 hours,
  though finishing in less time is possible by skipping text content or simply
  knowing your way through the Obelisk.
  .
  A Puzzle helper function is available on the options menu for those stuck in
  Unobelisk. It doesn't skip any puzzle, but hints to solve them gets more obvious
  in some text files or even on the map.
  .
  There's also a challenge difficulty mode if the default one feels too easy. A
  ranking system exists exclusively for this mode, rating the player's performance
  based on the final game playtime, number of times healed in restoration devices
  or the collection of optional modules.
  .
  Controllers are natively supported. The ones using the DirectInput standard will
  have problems with button placement but there's a menu option fixing this.
  .
  While there's only one active dev behind Unobelisk,  it uses assets, music, raw
  graphic materials and others from a number of people that makes their great work
  available with free licenses. Credits can be seen in the game's options menu.

  "It's a very impressive little adventure that delivers a tense, atmospheric and
  cerebral horror experience. The puzzle design is excellent and it generally
  stays clear of cheap jump scares, yet still has some very scary moments and a
  deep sense of dread throughout. There's no doubt in your mind that you're
  dabbling with dark arts that are best left alone, but the clever use of
  environmental storytelling does a good job of revealing why you're pushed to
  such desperate measures. Highly recommended."

game: VekWars (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/V/VekWars (USA)/VekWars (USA).json
developer: Washing-Up Software Projects, VideogameScrapbook
publisher: Washing-Up Software Projects, VideogameScrapbook
genre: Action
description:
  Sometime in the mid-1980s development began on a technology that, had it gone to
  market, would have changed video gaming as we know it.  A complete virtual-
  reality system meant for arcades, utilizing twin head-mounted vector monitors of
  the type used in games such as Battlezone, Tempest and Star Wars.
  .
  Sadly, funding for the project dried up before it reached completion, and the
  first game for the system - VekWars - never saw the light of day, continuing to
  exist only in rumor and a handful of blurry photographs from the period.
  .
  But now a team of digital archaeologists based in Austin, Texas have
  successfully extracted the source code for this game from a dusty 8-inch floppy
  disk provided by an anonymous benefactor.  We are pleased to present VekWars -
  fully updated to support modern virtual-reality systems (or non-VR monitors) and
  playable for the first time in over 35 years!
  .
  Note: VekWars is best experienced in VR, but if you're using the itch.io
  launcher, sometimes it can't find your VR headset.  If this is the case, try
  launching the executable directly.
  .
  How To Play
  .
  Welcome to the year 2385.  Humanity is locked in a deadly war with the evil
  Xilorian Empire. The key to winning this war lies in the unique properties of
  Vektrox Ore.  Found on only one planet in the galaxy, human mining colonies are
  under constant attack by invading Xilorian forces.
  .
  You are in charge of defending a cache of blue ore crates from waves of Xilorian
  ships that will attempt to steal them.  Your defense turret sits in the middle
  of a ring of crates, and is equipped with a powerful laser cannon, three
  missiles, and a shield system to protect you from enemy attacks.  Xilorian
  saucers may appear at any point around you and will fly in and attempt to steal
  the crates. Point at them with your targeting reticule and pull the trigger to
  fire your lasers and destroy them. If an enemy saucer is taking off with a
  crate, they will drop it if shot, but be careful not to accidentally hit the
  crate and destroy it yourself! If all crates are lost, then the game is over.
  .
  Watch out for red enemy fighters that will fire missiles at your turret. Shoot
  the missiles before they hit you to avoid losing shield energy.  After three
  direct hits your turret will be destroyed and the game will be over.
  .
  Use the secondary fire button to launch a highly-destructive NovaRocket at the
  enemy.
  .
  At the end of each attack wave your turret's energy shield is recharged, and a
  new NovaRocket provided, up to a maximum of three.
  .
  DEFEND THE CRATES!

genre: Role Playing
description:
  Verdant Skies is a life simulation game born from a love for games like Harvest
  Moon and a desire to create something unique with modern gameplay and deep
  storytelling. Lose yourself in the lovingly hand-painted alien world of Viridis
  Primus. Ensure the success of the colony as you make friends and pursue romance
  with a diverse cast of characters. Demonstrate your mastery of the farming
  system by creating the perfect crop hybrid using the genetic splicing machine -
  or spend your days painting and making pottery. The possibilities are endless!
  .
  With many natural skin tone options and tons of unique hair styles and clothing
  choices you can easily craft your perfect avatar. Unlike many games in this
  genre, Verdant Skies doesn't ask you to choose a gender when you create your
  character. As you help to grow the colony, you will unlock additional datable
  residents.
  .
  Split your time wisely between activities as you help to build your colony.
  Gather resources, decorate your home, grow crops, go spear fishing, cook
  interesting meals, befriend your fellow colonists, and maybe even fall in
  love...

publisher: Glitch Games
genre: Adventure;Puzzle
description:
  Veritas is a game of mystery and discovery from Glitch Games, creators of the
  Forever Lost trilogy, that poses the question; what is truth, and does it even
  matter?
  .
  Having volunteered to take part in a study conducted by Veritas Industries, you
  now find yourself waking up in a small room with no memory of what happened the
  day before.
  .
  The last thing you remember is signing on the dotted line and following some
  nice people wearing white coats, but they couldn't have been lying to you could
  they? They were doctors for goodness sake...
  .
  In the full compact narrative puzzle game, you'll:
  .
  Explore a dark and foreboding world full of lies and mysteries. You'll need to
  explore the entire facility to work out what happened and how you can escape.
  .
  Take photos of everything you find using the Glitch Camera. Be they posters,
  clues, walls, or disturbing blood stains - and use them later to help solve
  puzzles and piece together the mystery.
  .
  Solve lots of puzzles, ranging from inventory based item puzzles all the way to
  pun-based conundrums. All intricately designed to move the story along, you'll
  find no pointless filler here - just regular purpose made filler.
  .
  Be entranced by the beautiful soundtrack composed by Richard J. Moir. It's so
  good you won't mind listening to it, on repeat, forever, while you're trapped.
  .
  Use the Glitch Camera to:
  .
  Take photos of everything you find. Be they posters, clues, walls, or disturbing
  blood stains.
  .
  Write notes on them like a real detective. Use less paper, kill fewer trees,
  save the planet!
  .
  Use your notes to solve puzzles. Pop multiple photos out so that you can look at
  them at the same time.

developer: Royal Polygon
publisher: Royal Polygon
genre: Strategy;Racing
description:
  Race cars in classic motorsport style. Each corner is a chance to outmaneuver
  the other drivers, every straight a flat out drag race. Fast-paced strategy
  relies on your reflexes to pull off split second maneuvers. Feel your car's
  momentum, find the rhythm of the track, and drive like a racing driver.
  .
  Guide your car's driving line to take each corner quickly while finding a gap to
  overtake other drivers. On straights, be quick on your gears and late on the
  brakes to get to the corner first, always on the edge of spinning or crashing
  out. Spend an entire lap trying to close the distance to the car ahead, choosing
  the right corner to make your move.
  .
  Other drivers break your rhythm, forcing you to adapt your driving and how you
  tackle corners. Each track is unique and you have to learn the fastest route
  through corners and sections. Rain changes your car's behavior while you deal
  with decreased visibility. With a simple control scheme, victory will come from
  out-thinking and out-driving everyone else.
  .
  Inspired by the classic era of formula racing around the Mediterranean, each
  environment is a colorful and hand-built racetrack, all alongside an originally
  produced surf rock soundtrack.
  .
  Featuring

  Four player local and online multiplayer
  .

  .
  Vilmonic is a living virtual world. Your goal is to bring life back from the
  brink of extinction.
  .
  Protect and breed unique pixel-art life forms whose pixels and color have
  meaning. Experiment with natural and artificial selection. Craft tools,
  construct buildings and change the environment. Uncover the secrets of the past
  as you dig up ancient tech and fend off the mindless haywire zombitons.
  .
  Don't be fooled by the SUPER CUTE look, Vilmonic is a deep and complex
  ARTIFICIAL LIFE SIMULATOR!
  .
  Evolving genetic code generates each creature's pixel-art body.
  .
  The shape, or morphology, of each animatroid or fungol is determined by its
  genes. Genes control the bending of internal bones or branches. Pixels cover the
  bones to create the shape of the body. The shape of the body and the number of
  different pixels determine the physiology of the life form.
  .
  Pixels and body shape determine biological function: hydration, nutrient use,
  movement, perception...
  .
  Each life form has a metabolism that processes hydration and nutrients at a rate
  determined by the metabo gene. The larger the life form (the more pixels in its
  body), the more hydration and nutrients it will need each metabolic cycle.
  Surface area determines how much hydration each life form evaporates. The more
  wrinkled the body is, the more surface area there is.
  .
  Simple graph-shaped brains create emergent behavior: fear, agression,
  attraction...
  .
  A simple set of rules, derived from genes, controls the behavior of each
  animatroid. Animatroids have external sensors (motion/scent/water) and internal
  sensors (hunger/stress/thirst). Animatroids' brains have attraction/repulsion
  relationships between these sensors. It is these relationships that determine
  each animatroid's behavior.
  .
  Natural selection and breeding are the only way to evolve your life forms -
  unless you "cheat" with genetic engineering!
  .
  Your animatroids and fungols will evolve over many generations into new species.
  The genetic code of each life form is passed down to its offspring during
  reproduction, with a chance of mutation. Evolution is a slow process. To speed
  things up, try crafting and drinking a lot of sugary beverages. Toxic waste can
  also be useful (and dangerous!) It can cause drastic mutations in offspring.
  .
  Export your creatures and share them with friends!

  Void Runner
  .
  Teleport Through Obstacles In This Fast-Paced Infinite Runner
  .
  In Void Runner, your objective is to survive for as long as you can by avoiding
  obstacles. In this infinite runner, you teleport instead of jumping. This means
  you can teleport through obstacles, but be careful, teleport too soon and you
  might end up in a wall.
  .
  Void Runner was created in collaboration with my brother. We were inspired by
  other infinite runners but wanted to take a different approach to how you avoid
  obstacles. We hope you enjoy playing Void Runner as much as we enjoyed making
  it.

developer: D. W. O'Boyle
publisher: D. W. O'Boyle
genre: Action
description:
  Void Wisp is an ambient arcade runner where you earn points by coming close to
  obstacles without crashing.
  .
  You are a wisp. A collection of random energy that has coalesced into a sentient
  form. You float through the great nothingness that permeates existences,
  skimming off aether from the whatever that is nearby.
  .
  The gameplay is simple. You have two buttons; one moves you up and the other
  lets you glide. Typically you'll be holding the glide button to slow your
  descent when an obstacle comes near so you can grind along the top or bottom for
  points. The closer you are the more points you'll earn. You'll crash if the
  center of the Wisp contacts an obstacle.
  .
  Below is a short overview of how this game works.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Simple gameplay that's easy to pick up and hard to master. Designed for both
  short spurts and long sessions.
  .
  4 Game Modes each with a unique twist.
  .
  In Classic Mode you'll start to lose points the farther you go, so you want to
  get as many as quickly as possible.
  .
  In Caravan Mode you have one minute to score as much as possible. Crashing will
  lower the amount of time you have.
  .
  Survival Mode is the most complex mode. A timer is always ticking down but can
  be refilled by collecting luster and having a high multiplier. The game gets
  faster and you earn more points the further you make it.
  .
  In Traveler Mode there are 40 premade levels each with 5 goals to complete. You
  will face unique obstacles not found in the other modes.
  .
  Accessibility options that let you customize the game's looks, controls, and
  difficulty.
  .
  You can change the appearance of the game and character to better suit what
  makes you comfortable.
  .
  Supports mouse, keyboard, and gamepad. All with fully remappable controls!
  .
  Dreamy ambient music that partially reacts to how you play.

  ***Development of Volo Airsport is on a permanent hiatus***
  .
  Full source code available at: https://github.com/mzandvliet/VoloAirsport
  .
  Latest version: v3.7.4 Parachute Release
  .
  Volo Airsport is about the joys of skydiving and the beauty of nature. Try your
  hand at wingsuits, either flying as close to the mountains as possible, or
  soaring high and enjoying the view.
  .
  Flying with a human body is an experience that is fundamentally different from
  piloting other aircraft; it can be as elegant as it can be clumsy. As such, Volo
  completely simulates the motion of your body, and you can see, hear and feel the
  way it interacts with the air around you.
  .
  The core gameplay is all about learning to master the complex interplay between
  your body, the wind and gravity. Your first few flights can be quite like
  learning how to walk for the first time! Don't worry though, unlike in real life
  you can always try again.
  .
  Enjoy, and blue skies!

  "Journeys begin and end; the story does not."
  .
  -Old Mareman Proverb
  .
  Much of Marema was destroyed by the Empire of Garen decades ago. The radioactive
  fallout destroyed most of the tropical rainforests and verdant countryside for
  which Marema was famous, leaving behind only a desert waste known as "The
  Deadlands".
  .
  Now, two young adventurers prepare to claim their piece of the Deadlands, not
  realizing that they will soon be swept up in the latest chapter of a struggle
  that has been playing out for thousands of years; a war for the very future of
  mankind.
  .
  And it remains to be seen if they will survive the Volt Age...
  .
  ------------------------------
  .
  A Dynamic World with a Rich History:
  .
  -Learn about the history of Marema, expose the dark secrets of The Reclamation,
  and uncover a vast struggle between mankind and the gods reaching back thousands
  of years.
  .
  -Interact with the world around you in a variety of ways. Pick locks, scrap old
  machinery, and use tools to take control of your surroundings.
  .
  A massive continent, begging to be explored...
  .
  A Story You Can Play at Your Own Pace:
  .
  The story begins with two adventurers seeking to claim their piece of the
  Deadlands...
  .
  -No quests to save the world at Level 5 here! Take your time learning the
  nuances of the world as you are eased into a story which grows and advances
  organically. Most towns will continue to offer new challenges long after you
  first discover them.
  .
  -Level grinders rejoice! New quests and areas will continue to open up as the
  party's level (and reputation) grows, with optional challenges all the way up to
  Level 90!
  .
  -Two very different paths await you! Save the world, seek the truth, and fight
  for what you believe...the choice is yours.
  .
  Uncover secrets forgotten for hundreds of years as you explore...
  .
  A Lively and Unique Cast of Characters:
  .
  -Meet a diverse cast of more than a dozen characters, each with their own
  reasons for choosing to help (or hinder) the protagonists.
  .
  -In addition to their normal abilities, many allies possess passive skills which
  will let you interact with the environment in new ways or even add unique buffs
  to the party!
  .
  The tech-savvy Nyla is able to locate valuables the party would otherwise
  miss...
  .
  An Experience Like No Other:
  .
  -Immerse yourself in an amazing soundtrack featuring works by Aaron Krogh, J.C.
  Brickston, Darren Curtis, and  world-renowned composer Hiroki Kikuta!
  .
  -Battle against over 60 original enemies, ranging from the simple Barrel Sludge
  to the terrifying Goni, with several hostile factions and nearly a dozen unique
  human foes to round out the threats your party will face.
  .
  -Nearly 400 pieces of gear ranging from swords and shields to sniper rifles and
  force fields means you can customize your characters to suit your play style.
  .
  Unleash powerful abilities on a variety of unique and deadly foes...

game: Vulture (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/V/Vulture (USA)/Vulture (USA).json
developer: Cubic Timeline Productions
publisher: Cubic Timeline Productions
genre: Shooter
description:
  Vulture is a build-em-up arcade shooter with a retro aesthetic. In Vulture, the
  player controls a drone provided by the local military as it engages various
  types of enemies who have invaded the planet. As the player progresses through 9
  levels of intense combat, they will encounter increasingly larger and more
  powerful enemies. Players are ranked at the end of each level based on their
  score and number of enemies destroyed. High rankings give better rewards!
  .
  Destroyed enemy drones will drop credits, power-ups and blocks that the play can
  use to improve their drone. Players can use the in-depth build screen to create
  new designs of drones to use. As the player progresses, they will unlock larger
  templates to build their drones. The design grid starts at 8x8, but increases up
  to 32x32 by the final levels.
  .
  Blocks used in the construction of drones all have specific attributes that
  change how the players drone will function. All blocks have Power and CPU costs
  that must be met using system blocks in order for the drone to be able to
  function.
  .
  Hull Blocks: Increase durability and provide structure
  .
  Wing Blocks: Increase maneuverability
  .
  Weapon Blocks: Provide firepower
  .
  System Blocks: Provide Power and CPU for weapons
  .
  Shield Blocks: Provide additional protection
  .
  Engine Blocks: Increase speed
  .
  Legendary Blocks: ????????
  .
  Players can also equip radar systems which will allow enemies to be located
  before they come onto the screen. The radar can be improved to have increased
  detection range and can allow players to plan their route through a level with
  ease.
  .
  Players have access to 5 different weapon types: Plasma, Missiles, Orbs, Flak
  and Laser. Each of these weapon systems has a Tier 1 and Tier 2 variant. The
  Tier 2 variants are more powerful but consume more power and CPU, and can't be
  unlocked until the later levels. Players can also equip bomb systems that allow
  the use of a large, screen-wiping weapon once per level.
  .
  There are 9 levels of Campaign gameplay as well as a Bonus level that can be
  unlocked by meeting specific criteria in the game. Levels can be replayed for
  higher scores and for players to collect more blocks to build with. Each level
  consists of many waves of enemies followed by a boss. Some levels also have a
  mini-boss halfway through. At the end of a level, players are given a score
  (which is the amount of in-game credits received), a letter score (S rank to D-
  rank), and several items and blocks based on their achieved rank.
  .
  Giving players the ability to design their own drones will allow for many
  different strategies to be used. For example, weapons all have different rates
  of fire, which can be modified by capacitor systems installed on a drone. Using
  a single weapon type will yield a very different play experience than using
  multiple weapon systems. Changing the shape and size of a drone will greatly
  affect its maneuverability. The player must balance many factors to create a
  drone design that will be successful!
  .
  Fight! Collect! Design! Defend Your World!

  "Summed up in a single word, it would be 'beautiful.'" - David Wolinsky, Common
  Sense Media
  .
  "An introspective 'Oregon Trail'" - David G. Allan, CNN
  .
  "A remarkable experiment in translation. As contemplative as its source
  material, it forces an anti-reflexive pace and coddles at its center an
  appreciation of calm and quiet."  - Jason Sheehan, NPR Reading the Game
  .
  Play as philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau in his experiment in
  self-reliant living at Walden Pond. Live off the land, seek out the small
  wonders and beauties of the woods, and find balance between your need to survive
  and your desire to find inspiration.
  .
  Walden, a game is a six hour, exploratory narrative that begins in the summer of
  1845 when Thoreau moved to the Pond and built his cabin there. You follow in his
  footsteps, surviving in the woods by finding food and fuel and maintaining your
  shelter and clothing.
  .
  At the same time as you strive to survive off the land, you are encouraged to
  explore the beauty of the woods and the pond, which hold a promise of a sublime
  life beyond your basic needs. And, you can interact with characters from
  Thoreau's life including mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, sister Sophia Thoreau,
  editor Horace Greeley, activist A. Bronson Alcott, naturalist Louis Agassiz
  among others.
  .
  The game follows the loose narrative of Thoreau's first year in the woods, with
  each season holding its own challenges for survival and possibilities for
  inspiration. It features the voices of Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild, Milk) as
  Henry David Thoreau, Jim Cummings (Darkwing Duck, Sonic the Hedgehog) as Ralph
  Waldo Emerson, Misty Lee (The Last of Us, BioShock Infinite), and Tony Amendola
  (Stargate SG-1, Once Upon a Time) as Bronson Alcott.
  .
  Walden, a game has been a labor of love by a very small core team working over
  the past ten years. We sincerely hope you enjoy the experience and welcome your
  feedback! If you are an educator and would like to use Walden in your classroom,
  please contact us via our support form.

  "There are two kinds of people in the world, is what I think.

  There are 'normal' people. Those people smile and talk easily, look people in
  the eye and laugh. Those people walk right up to strangers and talk to them, and
  come away as friends. They smile, they feel things, and they're just... Destined
  to be surrounded by people, it seems. They'll be successful and happy and loved.
  .
  And then there are other people, who are like me.
  .
  We don't talk that easily.
  .
  We don't even feel very much.
  .
  At least, I don't."
  .
  Megumi Shimizu's life is routine and monotonous. Get up, go to school early,
  fulfill her duties as class leader, try to deal with Inoue, and go home and do
  it all again tomorrow. She has no friends, her life doesn't seem like it'll go
  anywhere...and she's fine with that.
  .
  She's used to it, just like she's used to the cold, numbing winters in her
  hometown of Ikigai.
  .
  Then one day, a new transfer arrives. A new transfer who is instantly liked by
  her classmates and teacher, who is everything Megumi is not. Bubbly, sweet,
  happy, social.
  .
  And for some reason, this new girl, Hinata Mikami, thinks Megumi is nice and
  wants to be friends. And Megumi is stunned to find she likes Hinata too...
  .
  Little by little, Megumi's cold and unfeeling world sounds less and less

  It's not what you say, it's how you say it. We should talk is a short-form
  narrative game that will make you think carefully about the words you choose,
  coming Thursday July 16th 2020 to Windows, Mac, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Linux,
  and Nintendo Switch.
  .
  In We should talk, you'll use the sentence spinner to piece together modular
  sentences in response to the in-game characters. Choose your words carefully to
  express yourself as you discuss ongoing problems about life and romance with
  Sam, your in-game partner, over text messages, while also chatting with friends
  and strangers at your favorite local bar.
  .
  The combination of words you choose impacts the conversations you have, how
  genuinely you can connect with your partner, and whether your relationship can
  survive the night. It's up to you how you respond-depending on how you
  communicate, you'll see one of many possible endings.
  .
  Personalized Choices: Using the sentence spinner, make choices that connect with
  you. Countless options abound-be yourself, or role play someone you never
  thought you could be.
  .
  Unique Characters: Your night at the bar is more interesting thanks to all the
  unique people you encounter. Find your healthy balance between chatting with
  your friends and keeping up with the texts from your partner at home.
  .
  Different Paths: Your choices drastically affect the way folks respond to you,
  leading to one of many different paths in each conversation. Will you be
  accommodating, flirty, stand-offish, or somewhere in-between?
  .
  Multiple endings: Play again and again to find all 9 possible endings.
  Conclusions aren't based on a specific path or route the way many traditional
  narrative games branch, but instead the endings are based on the tone your
  responses express throughout the game. What do your relationships look like at
  the end of the night?
  .
  Realistic conversations: Experience the emotions that come with real
  conversations, whether it's the the joy that comes with teasing a friend, the
  anxiety that comes with a heavy text message, or the frustration of navigating a
  touchy conversation with a creep. Express yourself as clearly as you can and
  hope that your conversational partner understands, though there's always a risk
  they might interpret your words differently than you intended.

developer: Triple Topping
publisher: Triple Topping
genre: Adventure
description:
  Welcome to Elk is a biographical adventure set on an island like no other, where
  every character you encounter has a story to tell. From the weird and wonderful
  to the dark and desperate, all the tales told on Elk are based on true stories
  of life on the road less traveled.
  .
  Tales of real stories
  .
  Welcome to Elk, an adventure game set on a fictional island stitched together
  with true stories and tall tales, and inhabited by the people who lived them.
  .
  Story
  .
  You play as Frigg, a young carpenter trading their busy life in the city for an
  apprenticeship in a small town. When she arrives in Elk, Frigg worries that the
  slower pace of life will be boring (they don't even have the internet), but
  quickly discovers nothing could be further from the truth!
  .
  Tragic stories told with love and sometimes humour
  .
  The stories reflect the drama of our lives, on Elk it's known that humour, love
  and death go hand in hand. Life may seem hard sometimes, but it is always
  followed by laughter.
  .
  Make new friends
  .
  On Elk, you will meet weird and wonderful characters - people whom the world has
  either ignored or forgotten. Follow their ups and downs, their odd drinking
  rituals and their unique ways of tackling whatever life throws at them.
  .
  Unique mini games
  .
  Help your new friends on Elk through playful mini games. All games are uniquely
  tailored to underline the story and the mood of the game.
  .
  Meet the people who told the original stories
  .
  We value the importance of storytellers, those who carry the tales of others and
  share them. That's why, in Elk, you will also meet the living storytellers who
  inspired us to make this game.
  .
  How we used true stories in the game?
  .
  True stories? how to use a true story in an ethical way? This is how we have
  dealt with it in Welcome to Elk:
  .
  The stories in Welcome to Elk, are told by the people who we know and/or were
  there when the events took place. All are told from memory. The way they are
  used both on our webpage and in the game is true to the core story but
  everything like names, locations and other details are changed, renamed and
  often re-framed to protect the real people behind them, therefore, we call them
  tall tales. The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true
  crime for example. They are rewritten and combined to one linear narrative.
  Characters may play a role in one story where they where not a part of
  originally and only us who designed it will ever know - or come close to the
  real truth of the stories.
  .
  Welcome to Elk might look like a "fun" game but it's about telling stories -
  some are filled with humour others are dark, but they go hand in hand.

  all. What happened to them?
  .
  What happened to Survey Team 4? is the third chapter in my One day at a time
  series. The series was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple
  games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:
  .
  I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.
  .
  No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.
  .
  Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.
  .
  All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.
  .
  With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I
  decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order.
  What happened to Survey Team 4? is based on the 2011 theme of "extinction".

  Wheels of Aurelia is a narrative road trip game set in the roaring Italian 70s.
  Half racing game, half interactive fiction, it tells the story of Lella, a

  Via Aurelia.
  .
  Wheels of Aurelia plays like an old-school isometric arcade racer, except that
  you get to chat with your passenger while driving. The story takes places at the
  end of the 70s - a time of terrorism, kidnappings, and political turmoil in
  Italy - and it will introduce you to that world and its dynamics thorough a cast
  of characters that you have never met in a video game. It's up to you to
  discover their motivations for driving along the coast of Italy and away from
  their homes.
  .
  Based on your choices - and the places you'll decide to visit - you may end up
  in car chases, illegal street races, or in tense debates that will make you
  wonder who your travel companions really are.

game: Where is Cat (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Computer/Itchio/W/Where is Cat (USA)/Where is Cat (USA).json
developer: bartbonte
publisher: bartbonte
genre: Action;Playground
description:
  'Where is cat?', created for the #oujevipo4kids contest, a game jam for games
  targeted to young kids (6 and older).
  .
  Since one of the possible constraints of the jam was that the game should be
  partly made by one or several children, I proposed to my own kids (aged 5, 8 and
  10) to make a game together and they immediately loved the idea.
  .
  We sat together for a brainstorm and also choose the 'playground' constraint,
  meaning the game should be inspired by a traditional children's game and we
  picked 'hide-and-seek'.
  .
  So the concept for the game and the story comes from the children, but they also
  drew a lot of the individual graphics: a lot of the object that are in the rooms
  were drawn by them and then imported, processed, colored and combined on the pc.
  They also made the artworks that were scanned and are on the walls in the game.
  .
  So I hope you enjoy this Bonte family creation. The children are very proud of
  their creation :) Making a game with your kids is fun!

  Come and relax with a hot and steamy coffee! In a town where adult entertainment
  is the new best thing, the Whipped and Steamy Caf is the best fun for all
  cosplayers with a wild and adventurous side! No shirts, no shoes, no shame and
  only the best service!
  .
  But this caf needs an extra pair of hands to stay steamy. Fortunately, our brand
  new hire Caffie just got the job! With a stoic demeanour and an utter lack of
  interest for the job, she'll have to manage the plans and decorations of the
  everyday, and meet up with the clientele. And, who knows? Maybe even make some
  unlikely friends...
  .
  Enough about that. Fire up for an experience that only a cosplay caf can
  provide! Here's hoping your time at the caf is just like we like our coffee:
  Hot, steamy, and with skimpy clothing!

  Features
  .
  A segmented visual novel with business and management simulation elements!
  .
  Select the coffee of the day, the snacks, and the decoration to appeal to
  different groups of cosplayers! Plan to increase group interest, tips, and come
  up with your own strategies!
  .
  Try to juggle between keeping them all happy, or see if appealing to some is
  more profitable!
  .
  6 cosplayers to meet! Try to appeal to their sense of decoration and you might
  see them more than a few times. And maybe even see more of them, if you know
  what we mean.
  .
  Considered unspeakable of by Apple's standards!
  .
  Controls
  .
  One handed mode, because you'll ask for it anyways. Just use your cursor to make
  all the decisions!

developer: Noble Robot
publisher: Noble Robot
genre: Platformer
description:
  You are Sprocket, an adorable ferret who knocks things over and steals junk on a
  space station in the far future! Escape your playpen and make your way to the
  shuttlebay with the most stuff!
  .
  Widget Satchel is a daunting adventure for one little thief, with fiendish
  puzzles and tricky platforming, but don't worry: You may lose some Widgets (or
  your socks!) along the way, but Sprocket can't get hurt and there is no "game
  over." Of course, it will take all of your ferret-y determination if you hope to
  stash away every Widget, discover every Trinket, and try on every pair of Socks!
  .
  Widgets: you want them! But beware, every widget you put in your satchel makes
  it heavier, making it a little bit harder to jump to the next platform or
  scramble past the station's maintenance bots. Levels can be relatively easy if
  you don't collect any Widgets, but they become a greater challenge as you fill
  Sprocket's satchel.
  .
  You'll reach special Fabricator rooms in each level, where you can exchange your
  Widgets for power-ups called Doohickeys. Bots giving you trouble? Equip yourself
  with The Wrench and show them what's what. Widget out of reach? Put on Jef's
  Boots and get up there! There are five Doohickeys to help you on your adventure,
  and you can build them in any order, so you can play the game (and discover its
  secrets) however you like.
  .
  High scores, hidden collectables, and secret paths are great, sure, but in
  Widget Satchel you can also just knock stuff over and get into trouble if you
  prefer! And the more mischief you do, the more mischief points you'll earn! What
  are mischief points? It's not important, but there are an awful lot of them!
  .
  Original soundtrack that dynamically reacts to your progress.
  .
  Replayable areas with "metroidvania-lite" pathing.
  .
  Sock-exclusive inventory system.
  .
  Trapdoors, lifts, hydraulic pillars, and other nonsense machinery to manipulate.
  .
  20+ game-changing "Feats" to achieve.
  .
  Human characters to mildly inconvenience!
  .
  Piles and piles of junk!
  .
  ...and more!

genre: Sports;Racing
description:
  Witchball is a post-reality racing game played by children in the year 2601.
  .
  Massive environmental change has made much of the world inaccessible, and long-
  distance travel impossible. Communities are isolated, but communication has
  advanced to the point where short distances between people barely exist at all.
  .
  In Witchball, two players compete in a high speed foot-race while simultaneously
  playing a 2D pong-like ball game on the surface of the screen. Points are gained
  in both aspects and tallied per lap, so it's important -- and tricky -- to
  manage the space better than the opponent.
  .
  _________________________________________
  .
  ( IMPORTANT NOTE:  Some flashing lights in the 2601 stage! )

  ** LOCAL MULTI-PLAYER ONLY **

  keyboard works fine though!)

  Originally used for fishing, glass buoys became associated with witches during
  witch-hunts in the late 1600s. Traditionally, a 'witch ball' is a glass orb hung
  in a home to ward away bad or evil spirits. The act of play, and games by
  extension, can function in a similar way -- kind of like a respite from the
  darkness. Games won't solve any problems, and neither will a ward, but
  safeguards and rest are necessary parts of life and games can provide that. A
  game as a ward, not an escape.

  Winner of the Human Human Machine award at A MAZE 2017!
  .
  Word After Word is a fast-paced local multiplayer word game that uses a massive
  natural language dataset to reward players for thinking naturally about common
  word usage and context. The game is played by two to four people, each with
  their own keyboard. Each player is given the same randomly generated series of
  adjectives one at a time. For each adjective, each player tries to identify the
  noun that most commonly follows it (e.g. fast CAR). Each player is given a score
  based on how often their noun follows the given adjective in a dataset compiled
  from over a half a billion words taken from magazines, tv, and books. For each
  prompt, there are potentially thousands of correct answers of varying degrees.
  As an example, let's say players were given the word "traditional." In the
  dataset, there are approximately 2000 nouns that would be accepted and scored.
  High scoring answers would be: role, family, and music.
  .
  Note: you need to plug multiple keyboards into the same computer to play.

  Beautifully simple. Endlessly challenging.
  .
  Word Forward is the puzzle game where every choice matters.
  .
  Can you use all of the letters in the 5x5 grid to make words disappear and clear
  the board? Word Forward isn't about spelling the longest words or the most
  clever - it's about carefully using every tile to declare victory in 500
  puzzles. It requires cunning and strategy -- Word Forward is a brain teaser that
  will really make you think!
  .
  SPELL words by tracing a line between tiles in any direction, including
  diagonally
  .
  SWAP any two letters on the grid by using a SWAP TOKEN, earned during gameplay
  .
  JUMBLE the tiles on the grid to replace all the letters with new ones when all
  else fails
  .
  CHANGE the letter on a tile to any other letter you choose using the SWAP
  MODIFIER
  .
  ELIMINATE stubborn tiles with BOMBS to get yourself out of a tight spot
  .

  1.1c patch notes:
  .
  Added back misplaced ending music intro (it used to be just the loop part of the
  track playing)
  .
  Made it possible to start the game without using openGL at all, see instructions
  above in the "The game doesn't run" section.
  .
  1.1b patch notes:
  .
  Fixed crash on using the smithy.
  .
  1.1 patch notes:
  .
  Fixed a bug where the orb could be mixed up with an item upon entering the
  throne room, enabling a premature win.
  .
  Ninjas and ghosts can now properly interact with special tiles in rooms.
  .
  Ninjas and ghosts have been forbidden to forge pickaxes, as that would be
  problematic.
  .
  Goblins' tiles and items brought to school will no longer be confiscated upon
  graduation.
  .
  The goblin tamer formation now includes a task separation course teaching them
  not to call the wolves when dropping an item.
  .
  Stopped wandering entities to pile up on tiles where there are already two other
  entities, which would push the oldest entity on that square into a frightening
  liminal space between states of being where they would be drawn but never again
  updated. (similar to a constant state of sleep paralysis if you will)
  .
  Swap control prompts will now go away if you ignore them for long enough and use
  the other swap controls instead.
  .
  Made it impossible for room descriptions to be partially off-screen.
  .
  Giving up in expansion mode will now trigger the score counting sequence.
  .
  Added back misplaced description for the vampire: they do steal enemy HPs.
  .
  Now displaying difficulty and how many in-game years it took to win the run in
  the ending screen.
  .
  You can now fast-forward through the ending screen with the action key.
  .
  Corrected a few typos.
  .
  Default window size is now smaller.
  .
  Shader can now properly be deactivated from the options. (no visual difference
  but may affect performences either way depending on your setup - in doubt, we
  recommend leaving it on)

  PREPARE YOURSELF!
  .
  Get ready to gorge on a four-course-meal of intense arcade action! WretchWorks
  presents the inaugural Arcade Pack; an homage to the golden age of arcade games!
  4 challenging treats for one low price.
  .
  These experiments in coin-op sensibilities all share the same ingredients, but
  are distinguished with a unique flavor and attitude. Here's what you can expect
  from each:
  .
  High-octane arena action! Try your best to survive against the endless
  onslaughts of mutants, aliens, and otherworldly beings!
  .
  Numbers (they go up)! Be it score, time, or combos, there's always a higher
  score to chase. Demise and triumph await!
  .
  Bizarre sights and sounds! Squishy bacteria, howling spirits, and chattering
  firearms set an appropriate tone for each of these arcade adventures!
  .
  MEET THE GAMES
  .
  Really Unique Space Shooter - Caught alone in a remote corner of the galaxy;
  help Captain Scott fend-off hostile alien forces as you collect new weapons and
  build as high a combo as you possibly can!
  .
  Cylor vs. The Endless Legions - Hungry for revenge, Cylor plunges deep into the
  heart of the Mutant Cat stronghold to end things once and for all. . . or at
  least die trying. How long can he survive?
  .
  Bullet Cell - White blood cells never have it easy; not when their health and
  ammo are one and the same! Defend the body from invading pathogens and enjoy
  surreal sounds as you budget your plasma to the very last drop.
  .
  Star Phantom - Battle space-faring ghosts in this 'inverted take' on an arcade
  classic. Ram into asteroids and harvest their chunks before the Phantoms can,
  and pray they don't try you as their next meal instead.
  .
  We hope you find these offerings both appetizing and entertaining! Be sure to
  hone those skills, because some day soon you may just see these devilish treats
  resurface outside the bounds of this collection.
  .
  IMPORTANT
  .
  This release is Windows-only for the time being.  Feel free to let us know if
  you would like us to bring this collection to Mac, Linux, or any other potential
  platforms! Please also get in touch if you have any feature requests for future
  updates or issues with this collection.

description:
  The power of Xenonature..
  .
  In the future year of 2011, Zeta Reak, kind, gentle king of the Xenolians, is
  overthrown by a powerful tyrant named the "Xenogunner".
  .
  The Xenogunner is a mysterious being capable of many frightening feats, using a
  power known as "Xenonature", a powerful energy that grants one trained in the
  use of it many elemental and non-elemental powers.
  .
  Zeta, too, is gifted with the powers of Xenonature. It's up to Zeta to overthrow
  the Xenogunner and reclaim the throne...
  .
  ...but is the Xenogunner actually the one pulling the strings...?
  .
  Intense Boss Battles!
  .
  Xenogunner is an intense boss-focused run-and-gun platformer based on games from
  the days of 16-bit consoles. With the addition of conveniences like mouse aiming
  and highly customizable difficulty settings, we believe that we've truly
  modernized a classic game genre that started in decades long since past.
  .
  The stages are short, the bosses are challenging, varied, and tense, and we give
  you as many lives as you'll need... because you'll need as many lives as you can
  get! Can Zeta best the Xenogunner...? Only you can guide him to victory!

  Find the level of challenge that suits you with granular difficulty settings.
  The ability to set quick respawn points at any time means repeating frustrating

  Dash into walls that reflect you. It feels really good and looks awesome!

  Did I mention there are no platforms?

  Doodles for days

  The hand drawn art style takes a fresh 'illustrated' approach, reminiscent of

  own thing, making the world feel alive.

  You Can Pet The Dog VR is a short VR game where you can fulfill the ultimate
  video game fantasy: petting the dog. Set in the beautiful opening sequence of
  upcoming game DOGGONE, you will experience a gorgeous hand-crafted art style and
  an adorable pup awaiting play time.
  .
  Features:
  .
  Play with a dog, and most importantly, pet the dog. This is why you're here,
  after all.
  .
  Throw a ball to play fetch, toss a stick and see the dog go after it, or just
  stop and pet that cute dog.
  .
  Relax in a breathtaking environment inspired by classic Disney films.
  .
  Experience the head-start to once-in-a-lifetime game DOGGONE, Raconteur Games'
  upcoming game about a lost dog.
  .
  There are games that will give you hundreds of hours of gameplay with branching
  narrative and unparalleled player choice. This is not one of them. In fact, it's
  the exact opposite. It's one thing, and one thing precisely: Petting a dog, and
  unplugging from the world.
  .
  You Can Pet The Dog VR was designed with bright colors and beautiful handcrafted
  landscapes. It has been tailored to be enjoyable for most levels of color
  perception, such that color blind players should be able to adjust a setting and
  enjoy the game no matter their situation.
  .
  If you enjoy this project, please consider wishlisting DOGGONE!
  .
  Compatible with Oculus Rift S and HTC Vive. Not tested with Index but should
  mostly work on Quest.

description:
  You have no idea how long it's been since you last set foot outside your cramped
  little apartment. You don't really talk to anyone. You can't focus on work. You
  barely have any appetite to speak of, literally and figuratively. Even casually
  reading Twitter makes you anxious.
  .
  Somehow, you thought moving to a new city would help you meet people you
  actually like. That you'd find fun activities to do and better opportunities all
  around. You used to be pretty good at faking your way around being a social
  butterfly. People actually seemed to like you, and the stuff you made and
  performed. But now? You can't even remember being that person.
  .
  Maybe you should go outside. Maybe it will help.

  You have been trapped in a time loop with your future self. They have committed

  Think carefully. Think strategically.
  .
  ...and good luck.
  .
  Your Future Self is a 1-2 hour long story-driven experimental text adventure
  with unique conversational mechanics, time loop based gameplay, and an
  emotionally gripping time travel mystery set against the backdrop of a darkly
  realistic vision of our world ravaged by climate change.

  You pilot mankinds's last, best starfighter. In a hyperspace subdimension far
  removed from Einsteinian physics, you must hold back a flood of vicious aliens
  and their hostile technologies. As you destroy the horde, your score (and
  multiplier) increases, but so does your enemy's effort to destroy you, as they
  send new creatures and ships against you: Enemy ships can be docile and aimless,
  or aggressively fire weapons of their own. Some pursue you when angered, or
  become more dangerous when killed. Others recklessly explode when activated by a
  nearby starfighter - can you use this to your advantage?
  .
  More kills means a higher score multiplier, but don't get hit! You'll lose a
  life and halve your multiplier. Grab powerups to boost Points and Multiplier
  further, enhance your Laser to cope with the onslaught, or detonate a Bomb to
  buy a second of breathing space. Score high enough and you might even get an
  extra life.
