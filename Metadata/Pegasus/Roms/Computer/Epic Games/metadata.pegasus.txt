developer: Twice Different
publisher: Twice Different
genre: Strategy;Turn-Based;Card Battle
description:
  Ring of Pain is a roguelike / card game / dungeon crawler mashup. Levels are
  generated randomly from decks of cards, and arranged in a format (like a ring)
  which lets you observe the level and strategise. As you interact with cards the
  dungeon dynamically adjusts based on what you're doing. Ring of Pain blends
  elements of modern roguelike/roguelite dungeon crawlers (Binding of Isaac, Enter
  the Gungeon etc) with a turn-based card game, set in a world distorted by your
  mind. A cryptic world of fear and delusion.
