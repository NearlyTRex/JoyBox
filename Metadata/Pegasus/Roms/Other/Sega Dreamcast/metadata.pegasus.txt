developer: WOW Entertainment
publisher: Sega
genre: Shooter
description:
  Alien Front Online is a Dreamcast video game originally released for the console
  in 2001.
  .
  In the game, players use armored vehicles to fight tense battles staged in
  large, interactive arenas. Players could choose which side they wished to fight
  for, the aliens or the human defenders of Earth, and could also choose one of
  three different vehicles to combat with; each having its own advantages and
  disadvantages. Although Alien Front was fully playable for one person, it was
  primarily designed as an online game in which up to 8 players (up to 4 on each
  side) could battle it out. Players move around the arena attempting to blast
  each other with their weaponry, while also looking for power-ups that will
  enhance their ability to wreak massive destruction. Typically, the game was
  played for a set number of minutes, after which the team with the most kills
  would be declared the winners. Being killed while playing the game had no
  serious consequences (you simply respawned in a different part of the area you
  were in), but it did reflect on your win/loss score.

developer: Warp Inc.
publisher: Sega
genre: Action;Horror;Role-Playing
description:
  It is Christmas of the year 2000. In the skies over Canada, Laura's plane has
  been hijacked by terrorists. The plane is filled with screams, shouts and fear
  as the hijackers terrorize the passengers and crew. In one of the seats a
  black-robed magician gazes into a crystal, chanting the phrase "Shadow, the
  final destroyer". Laura's compact begins to glow. A vision of a meteorite
  hurtling towards the Earth is reflected in the mirror. Suddenly the plane is
  struck by the same meteorite that appeared in the vision, and falls towards the
  frozen tundra below.
  .
  In the middle of a raging blizzard, Laura opens her eyes to find herself inside
  a mountain cabin. She was saved by Kimberly, one of the passengers of the
  wrecked plane. Ten days have passed since the crash but Laura can remember
  nothing, not even her name. The door of the cabin opens and one of the
  terrorists enters. While Kimberly and Laura stare in horror, he transforms into
  a hideous monster. He is not the only one. Other crash survivors and locals have
  mutated into terrifying monstrosities and attacked people. Is there anyway to
  survive this living nightmare? At present it is shrouded in mystery.
  .
  D-2 is a follow-up to D, though the two games are not directly connected to each
  other story-wise and also have significant differences in gameplay. D-2 combines
  a horror theme with shooter and role-playing elements. Exploring the vast snowy
  landscape and investigating the surroundings triggers extensive cutscenes that
  advance the narrative. The 3D engine allows free navigation around the world,
  though in-door locations have first-person navigation with limited movement. It
  is also possible to pilot a snowmobile, hunt for food, and capture photos.
  .
  Horrifying monsters will attack randomly (or serve as boss fights at specific
  points of the plot), at which point the player is taken to a separate combat
  screen. Laura must dispatch of the enemies by rapidly shooting at them, in a way
  not dissimilar to the shooting sequences of Snatcher. Enemies can attack from
  different sides, so the player often has to turn around and quickly react to
  their attacks. Laura's default gun is weak, but uses unlimited ammunition;
  stronger guns with limited ammo can be found by exploring the surroundings.
  Laura receives experience points for defeating enemies and eventually levels up,
  becoming stronger and having her hit points increased.

  Elemental Gimmick Gear is an action role-playing game for the Dreamcast console.
  Elemental Gimmick Gear uses hand-drawn art in an overhead view during
  exploration, then switches to 3D graphics during boss battles.
  .
  In the world of Tokion, a dome-shaped ancient ruin was discovered inside a thick
  jungle. During excavation, an egg-shaped mecha was found inside the ruins
  containing a sleeping man. No matter how hard scientists tried, he would not
  wake up. He was taken to a laboratory along with the machine to be further
  studied.
  .
  Upon analyzing the machine, they learned that it was over 5000 years old. They
  also could not find any form of power source. In time, the machine became known
  as "Elemental Gimmick Gear", or EGG for short. After extensive scientific
  analysis over a number of years, copies of the EGG were produced and used as
  vehicles.
  .
  100 years later, the ruin suddenly became active, extending a multitude of
  tentacles into the ground. They spread all across the land, destroying anything
  in their way. With the tentacles came a thick layer of fog that surrounded the
  ruins, and people gave them the name Fogna.
  .
  At the same time, the Sleeper who was discovered a century prior finally awoke.
  He had not aged a day since his discovery and had no memory of his past or his
  own name. Selen, who was with him as he woke, set him free without notifying the
  other scientists in the lab. She sent him to Fogna to begin searching for clues
  of what happened 5100 years ago, and to stop the tentacles' breeding.

description:
  Finding Teddy is a 2D point-and-click/tap adventure game with 8-bit retro style
  graphics. It is about a little girl whose teddy bear is stolen while she is
  sleeping by a monster that appears from her wardrobe. She chases after it when
  she wakes up and ends up in a strange world. The game consists of three parts
  along with a prologue and an epilogue.
  .
  The girl cannot move freely. Instead she moves from screen to screen, left or
  right, when there is a passage. Items in the environment can be picked up and it
  is possible to interact with the environment by clicking/tapping where allowed.
  When you click or tap the girl, her inventory appears around her as a circle of
  bubbles. Items from the inventory can be used in the environment by selecting
  them in the inventory first and then in the scenery. They do not need to be
  combined in the inventory. Along the way she will pick up two companions, a fly
  and a cat, who can also be used to solve puzzles. Many puzzles are also about
  deciphering the sound based alphabet used in the world. Sounds can be decoded
  into letters and appear in a separate section near the top of the screen. It is
  possible to die in the game, but the girl immediately respawns at the same
  location.

  Pier Solar and the Great Architects is an independently developed Sega Mega
  Drive game, released worldwide in December 2010 by WaterMelon, a group of
  developers from the Mega Drive homebrew and research scene. It is a turn-based
  RPG, and, at 8 megabytes (64 megabits) in size means it is currently the second
  largest Sega Mega Drive game available. It is the first internationally
  commercially released Mega Drive game since 2002's Mega Games 10 (not counting
  Super Fighter Team's releases, which have all been translations of games
  released in the 1990s). The game ships for $35 USD and has a clamshell case with
  a choice of three cover arts which resemble those used by Sega in Japan, North
  America and Europe towards the end of the Mega Drive's lifespan. Also included
  is a 24-page full colour instruction manual and a "MEGA Soundtrack Booster CD",
  containing the game's soundtrack, which, if the player has a Sega Mega-CD
  attached, can be used as an alternate source of the game's music during gameplay
  (however it is not a standalone Mega CD game). 500 "Posterity Packs" were also
  sold, with buyers receiving their names in the game's credits and instruction
  booklet.

  The game is set two months after the events of the first Resident Evil, in the

  Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police
  officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college
  student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and
  Claire make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from

  been killed already, and that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella
  headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two
  protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While
  searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is
  on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to
  be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.

developer: Tycoon
publisher: Infogrames
genre: Horror
description:
  Patterned after genre-defining games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill, The
  Ring: Terror's Realm presents a survival-horror experience with all the standard
  features one would expect. Players assume the role of Meg Rainman, the
  girlfriend of fellow CDC employee Robert, who, along with three other
  colleagues, met a mysterious and untimely death while playing a new video game.
  Determined to uncover the truth, Meg discovers the program on Robert's computer
  and is promptly sucked into a virtual world. Here, she becomes infected with a
  virus and has only the next seven days to live.
  .
  The Ring: Terror's Realm presents players with a handful of different
  perspectives including third-person, first-person, and a dynamic viewpoint
  similar purpose to that in the Resident Evil series, which provides constantly
  changing camera angles. The core gameplay has players traveling between the real
  and virtual worlds while acquiring items, solving puzzles, and killing larvae,
  lizards, gorillas, and other monsters. Initially armed with little more than a
  basic handgun, Meg will eventually amass weapons such as a shotgun, an assault
  rifle, a rocket launcher, and more.
  .
  When in the virtual world, players can make use of a flashlight to help Meg find
  her way through the darkened corridors. Other useful items she include healing
  serum and various context-sensitive objects that will aid her progress through
  the adventure. Often, Meg will be required to seek out a specific character in
  order to advance. Cut scenes highlight important encounters throughout the
  quest. Players can record their progress using devices scattered around the game
  world and can manage their inventory by placing unwanted items in boxes, which
  also are found in various locations.

  Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial, not to be confused with Sonic Adventure 2: Trial
  Version, is a free demo of Sonic Adventure 2 for the Sega Dreamcast, which was
  bundled with releases of Phantasy Star Online. It is an earlier prototype than
  Sonic Adventure 2 (Preview).
  .
  Sonic Adventure 2: The Trial includes one level (City Escape) from Sonic
  Adventure 2, with dialogue spoken completely in Japanese, accompanied by English
  subtitles. The translation for the opening helicopter escape cutscene is also
  slightly different - in this demo, one of the pilots exclaims, "What the hell?",
  while in the final version, this line was changed to, "What in the world?".
  .
  This demo differs in several ways from the final version, the most notable
  difference being that Sonic still wears his original trademark shoes. It wasn't
  until a few months before the retail release of Sonic Adventure 2 that Sonic
  Team revealed a merchandising deal with Soap Shoes. Other changes in Sonic
  Adventure 2: The Trial include a different logo, different road-side billboards,
  different sound effects, looser controls and physics, and an instrumental
  version of the song, Escape from the City.
  .
  When the player waits through the title screen, a video plays. This video shows
  prototype footage, including Sonic in Sky Rail, which Sonic does not access in
  the final version of Sonic Adventure 2.
