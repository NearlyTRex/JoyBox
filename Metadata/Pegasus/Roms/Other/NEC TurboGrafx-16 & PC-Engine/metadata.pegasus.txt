developer: Hudson Soft
publisher: Hudson Soft
genre: Action;Puzzle
description:
  Originally released only in Japan on the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16), Battle Lode
  Runner is a sequel to Lode Runner and its major draw is a 5 player mode. Players
  move around several platforms collecting gold. Various enemies inhabit the
  levels, and the player, armed with a drill, attempts to drill holes to capture
  the enemies. Unfortunately, this does not defeat the enemies, only disables them
  for a short time. After a few seconds, the enemies respawn and resume their
  chase of the player.
  .
  The five-player option was new to any incarnation of Lode Runner, and operates
  in a very similar manner to Bomberman, except with hole drilling instead of
  bombing.

publisher: NEC Avenue, Ltd.
genre: Shooter
description:
  One of the rarest games for the PC Engine, Darius Alpha was only offered to
  those who bought both the CD and HuCard versions of Darius Plus (Which doesn't
  make much sense, considering how similar the two versions are). People who just
  couldn't get enough of Darius could now play another variation on the same
  theme. Darius Alpha is built on the same codebase as Darius Plus, but has been
  remodeled into a so-called "boss-fight" game, e.g. a game where you only fight
  the bosses of a game or game series. You start out with an unequipped ship and
  must take down the boss of the first level, King Fossil. Upon defeating King
  Fossil, you are granted some slight upgrades and proceed directly to the boss of
  the next level.

description:
  Darius Plus was released in Japan on September 21, 1990 for the PC Engine, and
  was developed by Bits Laboratory and published by NEC Avenue. The Darius series
  went up against the big guns of R-Type and Gradius as another side-scrolling
  shoot 'em up with a player-directed power-up system.
  .
  Darius Plus is essentially Super Darius, the TurboGrafx-CD version which is the
  closest to Arcade perfect, but with fewer bosses. The same version could also be
  played on the SuperGrafx and had special features that would enhance the
  experience when played on that system in particular - similar to how certain
  Game Boy games would be enhanced when used with the Super Game Boy peripheral.
  Darius Plus shares this bonus aspect with its much rarer sister product Darius
  Alpha.

  J.J. & Jeff Detective Agency are assigned the task of locating a missing rich
  man, and you can choose either J.J. or Jeff to go on the mission. Your partner
  doesn't like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the
  way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels,
  destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three
  different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on
  the ground, blow gas out of them.

game: Jaseiken Necromancer (Japan)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/NEC TurboGrafx-16 & PC-Engine/Jaseiken Necromancer (Japan)/Jaseiken Necromancer (Japan).json
developer: Hudson Soft
publisher: Hudson Soft
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Long time ago, the Gods fought the Demons in a cosmic battle. To ensure victory,
  the Gods had to sacrifice part of their divine nature, and forge a weapon that
  had both good and bad in it - the "Evil Holy Sword" Necromancer. The demons were
  forced to dwell in the lower world, while the Gods remained in the heaven.
  Between these two worlds lies the world of humans. But the demons did not accept
  this plan for co-existence. They have murdered the king of the human continent
  Ishumeria, and it's time for the nameless hero of this story to seek out the
  legendary sword Necromancer, and restore balance in the world.
  .
  Jaseiken Necromancer plays like a traditional Japanese-style role-playing game:
  top-down navigation, linear story progression, turn-based battles against
  randomly appearing enemies, automatic leveling up, etc. A somewhat unusual (for
  the time) feature is the player's ability to choose two companions for the hero
  among six possible ones. These warriors are introduced to the hero after he
  accepts his quest, and the player can build a party of three, trying to balance
  between physical and magical skills they possess.
  .
  The game is also notable for its rather dark themes, uncommon for the
  representatives of its genre at that time. Enemies mostly include demonic
  creatures, and their death animation contains graphical gore.

game: Valkyrie no Densetsu (Japan)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/NEC TurboGrafx-16 & PC-Engine/Valkyrie no Densetsu (Japan)/Valkyrie no Densetsu (Japan).json
developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
genre: Action
description:
  Overhead action game. Traverse swamps, canyons, castles and caves armed with
  your sword that fires upgrade able bolts of energy from its tip. The action also
  includes a few puzzles and there are some original ideas (like the level where
  you have to catapult yourself from one place to another).
  .
  The PC Engine version of the game sports a big number of differences that almost
  make it a new game; the stage design has been changed, new stages have been
  added, the players are given passwords to save their progress, there is a new
  extra boss battle before the players fight the last boss (Kamuzu), and the
  ending is completely different from that of the arcade version (however, like
  many other Namco PC Engine conversions, the graphics and sound are inferior to
  that of the arcade version due to the fact that it is an 8-bit console).
