description:
  The prequel to 1942, like the other games in the 19XX series, is a top down
  shooter set in WWII.
  .
  One or two players control a P-38 (for player 1) or a Mosquito (for player 2),
  shooting enemy airplanes and ships. As in the previous games, one button shoots
  the airplane's weapon (which is upgradeable by collecting power ups left by
  enemies) and the other makes the airplane loop, destroying everything on screen
  (or causing extra damage to bosses, fought at the end of each level). The
  regular ammo is infinite, while the upgraded weapons have limited ammo. When the
  weapon button is held down, a bar at the bottom of the screen is charged and a
  special shot can be released, which varies in effect from weapon to weapon.
  .
  The airplane has a life bar which starts with three points. Each hit taken or
  loop used will consume one life point. The player will earn new life points at
  the end of levels or by collecting proper power ups. Other power ups available
  are auxiliary side and ghost airplanes. Three continues can be used, and one
  point is added to the score when one of them is used (a feature first introduced
  by this game and then copied by other shoot-em-ups).

  .
  The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the
  Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the
  players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly
  through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato
  and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge
  battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist
  of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother
  Bomber that needs to be destroyed.\n
  As in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks
  (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop
  like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942,
  the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a
  complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a
  health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.

  1943: The Battle of Midway Mark II is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game
  released exclusively in Japan by Capcom in June 1988. It is the third game in
  the 19XX series, an update of 1943: The Battle Of Midway, released a year prior.
  The title of this game translates from Japanese as "1943 Modified - Midway Naval
  Battle"
  .
  Not a proper sequel per se, 1943 Kai is a Japan-only re-vamp of the original
  1943 that keeps the same setup and gameplay, while making a few minor tweaks
  here and there for variety's sake. A sturdy biplane replaces the staple P-38,
  the level count has been reduced from 16 to 10, and the weapon selection
  available from the 'Pow' icons has been increased to include the rare 'wingmen'
  option and a super-efficient 'laser' (a special weapon that could only be
  obtained via a hidden code in the foriginal 1943). Not just that, every weapon
  can now be individually powered-up by picking up the same icon twice - so word
  to the wise: go for two lasers and some wingmen immediately.
  .
  Well, some might say that it is almost exactly the same as its predecessor, yet
  1943 Kai does have a slightly different flavour: it features an all-new
  soundtrack, and the overall rhythm of the game game has been increased. If
  anything, the core of the game is better - but then its kitsch biplanes,
  over-the-top weaponry and outrageous background colours (red sea?) give it a
  slightly tacky re-hashed feel, and make it loose the gritty pseudo-realism of
  the original.
  .
  The difficulty has been upped so that the game is even more unforgivably
  fierce... It's a quicker, tougher challenge - a souped-up remix specifically
  concocted for those who enjoyed the original.

  The overhead view of Officer Bob's police car scrolls in every direction. Catch
  wanted criminals and force them to confess. Eat doughnuts for extra time, avoid
  demerits and be sure to meet your quota of arrests!
  .
  Join Officer Bob on a very politcally-incorrect, never-ending quest to meet his
  daily quota by arresting hitchhikers, litterbugs, honkers, dopers, speeders,
  assaulters, murderers, and the A.P.B.'s themselves. Bring in A.P.B.'s for
  questioning but do not get caught or else they will be released because of
  police brutality.
  .
  Officer Bob starts each day at one of several police stations in the area. His
  daily quota is presented and you must use a targeting crosshair to arrest
  offenders by tapping the appropriate amount of times (or shoot them if you have
  the gun) to arrest them. Time and fuel are limited so you need to find donut
  huts and stands or donuts lying off the beaten path to extend your time and gas
  pads or tow trucks to get more gas. Once you have met your quota, scores are
  doubled for each subsequent arrest. Return to the station before time/gas runs
  out for a bonus.\n
  You get demerits for collisions without your siren on, crashing, exploding and
  running over pedestrians. You can lose one demerit every 10,000 points or if you
  drive a perfect day (meeting your quota without ANY collisions, explosions, or
  other wrong doing).
  .
  Every other day (starting with the 3rd day), the chief will present an A.P.B.
  that you can catch and provide information as to where he/she was last seen. You
  must then find and wear down their "resist-o-meter" and ram them off the road to
  capture them. Return them to the station before time/gas runs out and you will
  not need to fill your quota that day. After capturing, you must then make them
  confess by rapidly tapping the siren and gun buttons to bring the
  "confess-o-meter" up to full before the chief walks in and sees you choking
  them. If you get caught, the A.P.B. is let go and you get one additional demerit
  for each item you failed to take care of on your quota, thus it's usually a good
  idea to fill as much of your quota as possible before capturing an A.P.B.
  .
  There are 10 A.P.B.'s total, but the game does not end if you capture them all.
  The game ends when you hit your demerit maximum.

  In Akka Arrh, the player controls the Sentinel which is fixed in the center of
  the screen surrounded by a black octagonal field. The game uses a trackball to
  target enemies, similar to Missile Command. The player has to shoot all of the
  enemies outside of the octagonal field. If one or more of the enemies enter the
  octagonal field, the player can be able to zoom in the screen to shoot the
  enemies in the octagonal field and zoom back out to shoot at advancing enemies.

  Akka Arrh was never officially released. The game was field tested in arcades,
  but performed poorly, so further development was cancelled. Only three cabinets
  are known to exist.

description:
  Pilot a spaceship equipped with shields and auto-fire as you blast through level
  after level of rotating asteroids. UFOs and multi-segmented Killer Satellites
  take chase, searching for an opportunity to destroy your ship.
  .
  Asteroids Deluxe features modified gameplay intentionally designed to challenge
  players who had mastered the original Asteroids. Hyperspace was replaced with a
  new option called "shields", which creates a protective barrier around the
  players' ship. This barrier is only effective when the button is depressed and
  held unlike hyperspace, and depletes with use also unlike hyperspace. The
  players' ship was redesigned to include two side fins and a narrower body,
  keeping the overall ship dimensions identical to the original game. The ship has
  the same maximum velocity as in Asteroids, but can accelerate twice as fast.
  Firing is automatic, holding down the fire button will release a maximum of four
  shots on screen at a time. The asteroids themselves rotate as they travel about
  the screen. Firing accuracy of the two saucers was improved, and the saucers
  shoot both "wrap-around" shots and shoot immediately upon entering the screen
  both features designed to discourage UFO hunting. Atari added extra challenge to
  the game by introducing the "Killer Satellite" or "Hexagon", a snowflake-like
  object which breaks into three ship-chasing "Diamonds" once hit. Each diamond in
  turn can break into two "Sharks" or "Wedges" they resemble the dorsal fin of a
  shark which also pursue the players' ship. Overall a much more difficult game
  than the original Asteroids.
  .
  There are two versions of the software. The original release proved to be so
  difficult that Atari released a revised version that had easier game play. This
  new version was originally introduced in Europe and is often referred to as the
  "European Version". Determining which version you are playing can be discerned
  by noting when the first appearance of a Killer Satellite occurs - in the
  original version this is near the end of the second wave, in the revised version
  it will appear near the end of the first wave and moves much more slowly. Dave
  Sheppard was the designer.

  There are six rows of rocks to deal with. You start with a 6-storied platform
  and you lose one platform per row of rocks cleared. You score points for those
  rocks you prevent from reaching the ground. Of course, the farther the row of
  rocks, the smaller and faster they become. Your ultimate goal is to get enough
  points so that you can continue your game should you lose your first one. Get
  your hard hat out and prepare to catch some rogue rocks.

  The player moves the paddles back and forth to catch falling rocks. The paddles
  decrease as the rows of rocks decrease. The size of the paddles decrease as the

  Battle Circuit is a 2D side scrolling beat'em up drawn in a comic (manga) style
  in a futuristic science fiction setting. A group of bounty hunters must capture
  the mad scientist Dr. Saturn with a giant head.
  .
  The roster of heroes has 5 characters for the player to choose from: Cyber Blue,
  a human bounty hunter with cybernetic attachments to his body; Captain Silver, a
  humanoid shape-shifting hunter who has ability to project ice particles from his
  body; Pink Ostrich, a large, sentient, pink ostrich, who is always accompanied
  by its owner, a young girl named Pola Abdul; Yellow Iris, a part-time fashion
  model with claws and Alien Green, a space creature looking like a giant, moving
  plant.
  .
  Gameplay is quite typical for the genre, like in Final Fight, Streets of Rage,
  or Cadillacs and Dinosaurs - players go right, beat the enemies (player has
  access to various attacks), collect bonuses and money, and fight against bosses,
  for example Dr. Saturn and his robots. Players' abilities can be expanded by
  purchasing special "upgrade discs" after the completion of levels using coins

  You can choose from any of the three Toads: Rash a lean and fast fighter, Zitz a
  smart and balanced toad, or Pimple a big, bad powerhouse. Each has his own
  fighting style as well as his own repertoire of big-time Smash Hits that will be
  used to eliminate enemies. This game can appear to be just a beat-'em-up at
  first, but almost every level is different. Some levels are two and a half
  dimensional, like Double Dragon, and others are just two dimentional, giving you
  the ability to duck. One level has you hovering down a tunnel with a jet pack.
  On the last level, you ride in a hovering cruiser and fire at enemies with four
  different types of guns and a special weapon.

  The SYD mission was successful, but the current era was only one place under
  attack. The invaders also traveled back in time, hoping to rewrite history. Only
  the six experimental space-time battleships known as ZIG could stop them, but
  they were attacked upon taking off. Now trapped in the past, they have no way to
  return to the present.
  .
  Bermuda Triangle is a scrolling shooter designed by the same team as Ikari
  Warriors. The player must survive each of the 9 levels, which automatically
  scroll both up and down, long enough to reach and destroy the boss. The ZIG,
  being a much larger ship than most scrolling shooter ships, can sustain several
  hits before being destroyed, and has both a straight ahead shot and a rotating
  turret that can fire in 8 directions. SYD ships can be picked up in levels and
  will fly near the ZIG in four different formations. They can block enemy shots
  but will be destroyed if hit by enemy ships. Energy can be picked up as well,
  which will either restore lost health or, at full health, power up the attack of
  the ZIG and SYDs.
  .
  The arcade version uses a rotary joystick to control the turret, but the
  PlayStation port places the turret controls on the shoulder buttons.

genre: Shooter
description:
  First-person shooter. Use a 49-way optical flight control/joystick with thrust
  and fire buttons to fly through different levels (space, time warp, asteroid
  fields, etc.) shooting various enemies, objects, and picking up lost spacemen.
  Receive extra points for shooting all enemies in a wave, flying through
  obstacles, and reaching level 20, "Paradise".
  .
  You are in the cockpit of your spaceship flying through outer space battling
  wave after wave of deadly enemies. Stranded astronauts tumble through space, and
  you can rescue them to score additional points or ignore them and just try
  continuing to survive.\n
  Groups of enemies can attack from the front or the rear, and it is not unusual
  to have a dozen or more enemies on the screen at once, all firing deadly
  missiles at you or trying to collide with your ship.
  .
  Everything moves with true 3-D perspective, and you control your ship's flight
  with a Zaxxon-like joystick.Fire and thrust buttons are located on the joystick
  beneath your index finger and thumb(with optional buttons on either side of the
  control panel), giving you simple and powerful control with one hand.
  .
  The game has 20 different waves. The Attack Waves can be divided into nine basic
  types:Planetoid Waves, Robot Grid Waves, Saucerland Waves, Vampire Waves, Time
  Tunnel Waves, Outer Space Waves, Enduro Waves, Cat World Waves, and Mastermind
  Waves.The waves Armageddon and Paradise, each only occur once throughout the
  game.\n
  The game lets you choose the beginning wave for your game. You can start on any
  of the first four waves:Planetoids, Robot Grid, Saucerland, and Vampires. After
  you choose a beginning wave, the game begins. You start with three lives, and
  you are awarded an extra life every 100,000 points. Each life is equivalent to
  three shields, and one shield is lost each time you run into a rock, planet,
  enemy or missile. The shield indicator at the top of the screen lets you know
  how many shields you have left; the first collision takes away one-half of the
  shield indicator, the second takes away the rest of it and flashes an "ENERGY
  CRITICAL" warning and after the third hit the cockpit window shatters and a life
  is lost.
  .
  At the end of the game, you are given the option of beginning another game from
  the point where your first one had ended. If you insert another coin and press
  the start button before the 10-second timer expires, you can start playing right
  where you stopped,with the same score. Bonus lives are awarded at the same
  scores on continued games, so by using this feature you can "buy" a high score,
  but only up to Wave 20, the continuation option is no longer available; this
  makes the high score on the game more meaningful.
  .
  Throughout the game various kinds of enemies appear in groups. These groups vary
  in numbers from two to ten, and the number of enemies in the next group is
  unpredictable. Bonus points are always awarded for destroying an entire group,
  so you should always try to blast all the enemies in a group. This is true in
  all waves. The exact value of each of the group bonuses is explained in detail
  under each kind of wave below.
  .
  In addition to the group bonuses, a 100,000-point super-bonus is awarded for
  destroying all the groups in a Saucerland Wave, Cat World Wave, or Mastermind
  Wave.This feature is not included in the Vampire Wave.
  .
  Because of the group bonuses and super-bonuses, the best way to play is to try
  to blast every single nemesis you see. This is particularly important when you
  consider that the continued-play option does not work after Wave 20; if you are
  "buying" a high score by restarting after every game, you will need to make the
  first 20 waves count as much as possible. Or else, you will get to Wave 20 with
  a lower score than other players.
  .
  Throughout the game, except in the Time Tunnel Waves, you must continue to
  battle all enemies who attack you in most other waves, including Robots,
  Androids, Es (which can restore your shields to full strength, if you blast
  them), Runaway Ships, Flying Saucers, Vampires, Space Cats, Deathriders,
  Masterminds, Destroyers, X-29 Fighters, Starcruisers, Destruktor Satellites,
  Space Robots, Space Cowboys and so on. The Time Tunnel Waves are the only
  peaceful waves where there are no enemies at all but you attempt to rescue
  stranded astronauts as you do throughout the entire game.
  .
  In Armageddon, you will battle almost all the enemies from all the other waves.
  When you make it to Paradise, there are no enemies at all in that wave, and you
  do not even score any points. You just fly through space and watch a show. After
  the show is over, you are awarded 1,000,000 bonus points and three extra lives
  and then you are sent back to Wave 10.
  .
  The astronauts who can can rescue as you fly through space are worth 1000 points
  each, with the value increasing by 200 for each astronaut you catch without a
  miss, up to a maximum of 2000 points.

description:
  The object of Bosconian is to score as many points as possible by destroying
  enemy bases and ships. The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in
  eight directions and can fire both forward and backward. Each level consists of
  a number of green space stations that must all be destroyed to advance to the
  next level (a semi-transparent mini-map helps identify their location). Each
  station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central
  core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to
  destroy a station, and in later levels the core is capable of defending
  itself.\n
  Additionally, the player must avoid or destroy asteroids, mines, and a variety
  of enemy missiles and ships that attempt to collide with the player's ship.
  Enemies occasionally launch formation attacks — destroying the leader causes all
  remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores
  extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) also appears
  occasionally, which must be destroyed or the enemies will go berserk.

  Your goal in Bubbles is to clear each level, by maneuvering a soap bubble in a
  sink, cleaning the sink of ants, crumbs, and grease splotches, called
  "greasies".
  .
  Each ant, crumb and greasie earns points when collected, causing your soap
  bubble to grow in size, and form a face; a pair of eyes, a nose, then a mouth.
  The bubble continues to increase in size afterwards, as you grab crumbs,
  greasies and ants. Sponges and brushes will appear to absorb the crumbs, et al,
  taking the points away from you; they can be knocked away, but only once your
  bubble has a mouth, and will cause your bubble to shrink in size, along with
  losing some of your face. A cleaning lady will sometimes appear from the drain
  in the center of the sink, and sweep up the crumbs, etc. You must absorb the
  cleaning lady to receive the points she collected, but you must come in contact
  with her broom's bristles to get her broom.
  .
  A cockroach will appear from the drain after a time (preceded by a loud sound)
  that will head right for your soap bubble, absorbing any ant, crumb, or greasie
  in the way. If it comes in contact with your bubble, you lose a life, unless you
  have the cleaning lady's broom, which you must have pointed directly at the
  cockroach in order to kill it, and makes the broom disappear. More cockroaches
  will appear if you don't clean the sink quickly. After the last ant, greasie or
  crumb is collected, the faucet at the top of the screen turns releasing water,
  the sink drains, and you earn bonus points based on the size of your bubble. The
  level may also be cleared if the sponge, brush, cleaning lady, or cockroach gets
  the last greasie, etc. or if the debris goes down the drain themselves.
  .
  Other than the ways listed above, bonus points are earned by collecting ants,
  crumbs and greasies close to the drain, knocking sponges and brushes down the
  drain (when your bubble has a mouth), and jumping down the drain when the drain
  flashes green. Jumping down the drain skips a few levels, so you will reach the
  harder levels more quickly by doing this.
  .
  Additional ways of losing a life occur, when your bubble doesn't have a mouth:
  coming in contact with the brush or the sponge, by the level being cleared
  causing the sink to drain, or if you jump down the drain yourself. Coming in
  contact with the razor blades that appear in the sink in later levels are always
  fatal, so they must always be avoided. When you have lost all of your soap
  bubbles, the game is over.

developer: Atari, Inc.
publisher: Atari, Inc.
genre: Shooter
description:
  In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a
  magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are
  attacking in the player in continuous waves.
  .
  The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to
  score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller
  button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an
  insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three
  starting magic wands.
  .
  Insect Opponents and Mushrooms\n
  All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the
  player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are
  as the following:
  .
  The Centipede\n
  The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will
  have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will
  have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The
  third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus
  two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue
  to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached
  heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points
  than body segments.
  .
  Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving
  downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body
  segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will
  become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly
  disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.
  .
  The Spider\n
  The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It
  will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is
  hit in closer distances.
  .
  The Flea\n
  The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms.
  It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea
  will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much
  faster.
  .
  The Scorpion\n
  The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up
  speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.
  .
  Mushrooms\n
  Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the
  player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly
  destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and
  Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and
  are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body
  segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom.
  Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards
  the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially
  damaged mushroom.
  .
  .
  Game Difficulty and Variations\n
  The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert.
  Game Variations are as the following:
  .
  One Player\n
  Two Player Alternating\n
  Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.\n
  Dual Player Competition\n
  Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate.
  Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.\n
  Team Play Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is
  combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.
  .
  .
  Scoring\n
  The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of
  six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the
  following:
  .
  Centipede Head - 100 points\n
  Centipede Body Segment - 10 points\n
  Spider at close range - 900 points\n
  Spider at medium range - 600 points\n
  Flea - 200 points\n
  Scorpion - 1,000 points\n
  Restored mushroom - 5 points\n

  Cyberball is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using

  the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from "cool" to
  "warm", "hot", and "critical" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the
  ball, resetting it from its current state back to "cool" by crossing the 50 yard
  line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or
  fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along
  with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are
  tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of
  hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players

genre: Shooter
description:
  Defend the human population from swarms of attacking aliens. Extremely popular
  even though it was deemed a flop at a 1981 Chicago arcade machine trade show
  because of its difficulty. The attract mode for the game was programmed in just
  five hours.
  .
  Your mission, as captain of the Defender, is to protect the humanoids stranded
  on the planet from their alien abductors. The scanner will help you determine a
  strategy to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If you
  destroy the aliens after they have captured their prey, you must return the
  humanoids to the safety of the planet or they will fall to their death. If an
  alien carries its victim out of your range, the humanoid will mutate, join the
  alien force, and take to assault with deadly vengeance!
  .
  The challenge becomes ever more intense as the action progresses. Fighter ships
  Bombers and mines will test your skills. A direct hit will destroy the mother
  ship Pods but smash it into a swarming mass of mini-ships Swarmers which then
  must be wiped out! If you do not act quickly, the cosmic Baiter will attack! Use
  your two escape options only if all else fails! Your "Smart Bomb" power is
  limited and "Hyperspace" puts you into an unknown space warp. But beware! If all
  the humanoids are abducted, the entire planet will explode in a blinding flash!
  .
  Tips:\n
  Avoid using hyperspace unless you are about to die. Fighting off attacks,
  regardless of the number of enemies will make you a better Defender player.\n
  Baiters can usually be overcome by hitting the reverse button twice quickly.
  They will fly past you and be in range for your fire power. Do NOT try to outrun
  them as Baiters are faster than your ship.\n
  Swarmers are easy to defeat. You can hit reverse as soon as they fly past you
  and fly behind them. They cannot shoot backwards so you can blast away at
  will.\n
  At higher levels you will need to play God and even sacrifice some humanoids by
  killing them yourself to preserve the rest of the planet's population. The
  planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the humanoids from a
  fate worst than death mutation. Do not worry, these humanoids reproduce quickly
  and overpopulation has always been a constant problem. The planet will be fully
  populated at the start of every fifth attack wave configurable.

description:
  Atari's Dominos is a one, two or four-player video action game packaged in its
  own distinctively styled upright cabinet that rest directly on the floor. A
  23-inch TV monitor is monted in the top front of the cabinet, with the monitor
  viewing screen tilted back from vertical. The TV monitor viewing screen is
  covered with plexiglas panel. Dominos came in an upright two-player cabinet as
  well as a four-player cocktail cabinet. All cabinets were produced in 1976 and
  originally released in 1977.
  .
  Gameplay is a variation of the snake genre, in which players compete by
  surrounding each other with lines of dominos. Players change direction via a set
  of four directional buttons representing up, down, right, and left respectively.
  A player loses when they hit a wall, their own dominos, or their opponent's, at
  which point all the dominos in their line "fall" down. At the end of each round,
  a point is awarded to the winner of that round until the end point goal is
  reached. The point goal can be 3, 4, 5, or 6 points.

genre: Shooter
description:
  In the game, the player's ship is placed in a level with a number of bases to
  destroy. When all the bases are gone, the stage boss appears, who must be
  defeated in order to move on to the next stage. There are eight stages, and in
  all of them, except the final one, the scroll is not fixed; the player can move
  either left or right, though the stage loops. The final level consists of
  fighting again all previous bosses in succession and then facing the final one.
  .
  Opa-Opa uses two different attacks: the standard weapon (initially bullets) and
  bombs. He can also move down to land on the ground by sprouting feet and walking
  around until he flies again.
  .
  It is possible to upgrade Opa-Opa's weapons, bombs and flying engine to increase
  speed, as well as get extra lives. Before that, the player must get money by
  defeating enemies, bases or bosses, and access a shop by touching a marked
  balloon. Each time a new item is bought, they become more expensive. When the
  player chooses to exit or the time runs up, another screen appears, in which he
  or she can select what upgrades Opa-Opa can use; only one engine, weapon and
  bomb can be equipped at a time.
  .
  Some of the new weapons have a time limit that starts as soon as the shop is
  left. Some of the bombs can be used at any moment, but they are limited. On the
  other hand, the engines are permanent, though some of these actually makes
  Opa-Opa hard to control, as he moves too fast. The powerups can also be
  reassigned by reentering the shop or touch a balloon with the word "Select"
  written on it. If the player loses a life, all of the upgrades are lost.

  Forgotten Worlds, titled Lost Worlds in Japan, is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up
  game by Capcom originally released as a coin-operated video game in 1988. It is
  notable for being the first title released by Capcom for their CP System arcade
  game hardware. The game took two years to develop, with a production budget of
  US$5 million.
  .
  Set in a distant future, an evil god known as Bios has destroyed most of the
  Earth, turning it into a desolated wasteland known as the Dust World. Two
  nameless supersoldiers are created by the people to defeat Bios and the eight
  evil gods who serve him.
  .
  Forgotten Worlds can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The player
  controls a flying muscle-bound soldier armed with a rifle with unlimited ammo.
  The Player 1 character is equipped with a long-range automatic rifle, while
  Player 2 has a short-range wide shot. The controls in the original coin-op
  version consists of an eight-way joystick for moving the character in the air
  while flying and a unique rotatable button known as the "roll switch". Rotating
  the switch left or right allows the player to adjust their character's aim in
  one of sixteen directions, while pressing it causes the player character to
  shoot his gun. This allows for the player to move their character anywhere while
  keeping their aim in one direction. Pressing the switch rapidly will cause the
  character to perform a "megacrush" attack which will destroy all on-screen
  enemies, but at the expense of a portion of their vitality gauge.

developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
genre: Shooter
description:
  The gameplay in Galaga '88 is built on the same premise as that of the original
  Galaga game, but is in many ways more complex and more difficult. The game is
  divided into a series of 29 Stages distributed through eight Worlds. The
  starship Galaga accelerates between Stages and Worlds and even to higher
  dimensions (go to the section on Dimensional Travel below to find out more).
  .
  With the exception of the third and eighth, each World culminates in a
  Challenging Stage. There are six such stages to engage in any full game, and
  each begins with the on-screen announcement "That's Galactic Dancin'!" and has
  its own YM2151-generated song to which the enemy formations dance. In any given
  Challenging Stage, both the design of the enemies and their dancing formations
  shall vary according to the player's current Dimension. As in Galaga, the
  objective is to destroy all forty enemies before they fly away off the screen.
  However, refraining completely from touching any controls for the duration of a
  Challenging Stage awards a "secret bonus" ranging in value from 10000 to 25000
  points, and equal to the "special bonus" which would have been awarded for
  destroying all forty enemy aliens instead.
  .
  Galaga '88 introduces a variety of new enemies and behaviors. Most of these
  special enemies are worth varying amounts of bonus points when destroyed. Some
  enemies can combine into larger enemies which take multiple hits to destroy,
  while others arrive in eggs, explode in a shower of fireworks, grow with
  multiple hits, or sport armor which makes them invincible while in formation.
  Certain enemies drop small formations of tiny creatures that wiggle their way
  down the screen, and still others can act as escorts to incoming groups of
  enemies and then quickly dive at the player before leaving the game. Most stages
  also include various obstacles which appear once the enemy formation has been
  assembled. These can be destroyed with either one or several shots, and the
  first one on each stage will leave a "Warp Capsule".
  .
  At the start of the game, the player can select how many Galaga starships to
  start with (one or two), affecting their number of remaining lives. The game
  ends after the final boss is defeated (or when the player's last ship is
  destroyed or captured) - in the latter case, the player can continue the game
  for an additional credit. The Game Over screen shows the player's hit-miss ratio
  and a visual representation of their progress. If the player reaches Stage 27,
  the game also shows a picture of the final boss (damaged if defeated, but
  silhouetted if not). If the arcade operator has set the "continue" option to
  "on", the player also cannot continue if he is defeated on Stages 27-29.

  Galaga (ギャラガ Gyaraga?) is a fixed shooter arcade game developed and published by
  Namco in Japan and published by Midway in North America in 1981. It is the
  sequel to Galaxian, released in 1979. The gameplay of Galaga puts the player in
  control of a space ship which is situated on the bottom of the screen. At the
  beginning of each stage, the area is empty, but over time, enemy aliens fly in
  formation, and once all of the enemies arrive on screen, they will come down at
  the player's ship in formations of one or more and may either shoot it or
  collide with it. During the entire stage, the player may fire upon the enemies,
  and once all enemies are vanquished, the player moves onto the next stage.\n
  Galaga has proven very successful. The arcade version of it has been ported to
  many consoles, and it has had several sequels, most recently Galaga Legions for
  the Xbox Live Arcade service.
  .
  The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying
  insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and
  right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation
  near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing
  bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost,
  either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.
  .
  Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among
  these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the
  player's "hit/miss ratio" at the end of the game, and a bonus "Challenging
  Stage" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and
  out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying
  to crash into it.

  Giga Wing takes place during a fictional war within a steampunk setting. The

  on-screen when used. The game is based on the player(s) trying to destroy a
  medallion which possesses great power. Many of the bosses use the medallion as a
  weapon. At the end, it shows that an evil man who pilots a ship called the
  "Stranger" is the real person who is in control of the Medallion, and was
  responsible for the war, as well as other conflicts in the past including World
  War II, and you fight him three times as a mini-boss and as the last boss. He

description:
  The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With
  each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a
  powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by
  taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his
  control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three
  to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit
  all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the
  core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and
  the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make
  sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will
  be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the
  next galaxy which will be even more difficult to save. The game includes five
  different skill levels which vary in difficulty by supplying different amounts
  of ships to begin the game as well as different strengths of gravity.

  Controlling a cowboy in the Wild West you have to make your way through hostile
  cowboys of each level. Shooting barrels reveals power-ups such as boots, rifles

  knives, darts and boomerangs.
  .
  Gun.Smoke is very similar to Commando, another Capcom game, but with several
  differences. Whereas Commando is a run and gun game, this game is a scrolling
  shooter in which the screen scrolls upward automatically and players only have
  three ways to shoot, using three buttons for left, right, and center shooting.
  However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button
  combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like
  in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse,
  for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for
  faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. These items are found by shooting
  barrels and rifles, boots, and bullets can stock up to five.

developer: Konami

genre: Shooter
description:
  Gyruss (ジャイラス Jairasu?) is a shoot 'em up video arcade game developed by Konami,
  and released in 1983.
  .
  It was designed by Yoshiki Okamoto, who had earlier created Time Pilot for
  Konami. Gyruss was licensed to Centuri in the United States, and was ported to
  numerous games consoles and home computers. It follows in the tradition of space
  war games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.
  .
  Gyruss was the second and last game Yoshiki Okamoto designed for Konami, after
  Time Pilot. Due to pay disputes, he was fired after the release of this game,
  and soon joined Capcom, where he would write 1942 and the first Street Fighter
  game.
  .
  The game's background music is an electronic, fast-paced arrangement of J. S.
  Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565; this particular arrangement is
  similar in sound to "Toccata", a rock arrangement by the UK-based
  instrumentalist group Sky.
  .
  Gyruss is notable for using stereo sound, which according to the bonus material
  for Konami Arcade Classics, was achieved by utilizing discrete audio circuits.
  The game used three microprocessors: two Z80 microprocessors and one 6809, as
  well as an 8039 microcontroller. For the sound, five AY-3-8910 PSG sound chips
  and a DAC.
  .
  Gyruss was released in both upright and cocktail cabinets.
  .
  R.Hirst "KOO", M.Jones, "BOX" and the Elliott Brother's are arguably considered
  some of the best Gyruss players of the 1990's.

description:
  Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a
  high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast
  as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you
  gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your
  direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass...
  .
  The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is
  longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to
  perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so
  on.
  .
  Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your
  crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck,
  or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose
  several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again.
  .
  The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the
  force-feedback that was in the arcade version.

  robot1984 and destroy him.

developer: Williams
publisher: Williams
genre: Action;Platform
description:
  You are a knight flying on an ostrich, battling buzzard-mounted enemies. To fly,
  you repeatedly hit the flap button. To topple the Buzzard-Riders "the highest
  lance wins." Two-player head-to-head play is excellent.
  .
  Each player controls a different knight and each of them rides a different
  mount. The first player is a yellow knight who rides on a flying ostrich. The
  second player is a light blue knight who rides on a giant stork.
  .
  In each wave throughout the game, you must defeat every enemy knight in a joust.
  Everytime you defeat an enemy knight in a joust by ramming him atop his head, he
  will turn into an egg. You must then capture the egg before it hatches,
  otherwise, the egg will hatch and the knight will become the next more-difficult
  character. In other words, a Bounder will become a Hunter, a Hunter will become
  a Shadow Lord, a Shadow Lord will become a Bounder and so on. After the egg
  hatches, a new mount will fly out to pick up the newly-hatched enemy knight. You
  can also collect an enemy knight after he has hatched before he mounts his
  buzzard.
  .
  Sometimes the eggs will fall into the lava pits at the bottom of the screen in
  later waves. During the first two waves, there are platforms at the bottom of
  the screen that will allow you to walk over the lava pits, but in later waves,
  the platforms will be burned away. Sometimes, a pterodactyl will show up in some
  of those waves, usually if you take too long. The only way you can kill the
  pterodactyl is by ramming him in the mouth to desintagrate him.
  .
  If you have your feathered mount fly too close to either of the lava pits, The
  Lava Troll will reach out and grab your mount by the legs and pull you both into
  his fiery home. If this happens, you must have your mount repeatedly flap really
  hard to escape from the grip of The Lava Troll. The Lava Troll will also grab
  the enemy knights on their buzzards and occasionally pull them in with him.
  .
  Even in the later waves, platforms will collapse and disintegrate. Occasionally,
  there is an Egg Wave where you must grab all the enemy eggs before they hatch.
  As you advance to later waves, the difficulty constantly increases.

  Players get to choose any one of six monsters (four in the 16-bit ports) for
  battle, and two players can join forces to fight the monsters together. Battles
  end when one of the monsters is pinned for a three count or if time expires (in
  which case the player loses).\n
  The game consists of 12 total levels: the player first must defeat all six
  monsters, with the last monster being oneself, but in a different palette. Then
  the player must defeat the six monsters again, in the same order, but this time
  in different cities.\n
  Mega criticised the game, awarding it a score of 10%, with Andy Dyer making the
  comment "unforgivably bad. There should be laws to protect us from crud like
  this".

genre: Shooter
description:
  Legendary Wings is an arcade shooter influenced by Greek mythology. A heroic
  figure from ancient times thrust into a strange futuristic world, you must fight
  your way through six levels to defeat "The Devil" and save the day.
  .
  The primary gameplay mode is a top-down, vertical-scrolling shooter similar to
  Xevious and Capcom's own 1943. Your main weapon is used to attack flying
  enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement,
  land-based enemies. Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these
  both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every "upgrade" is
  worth a free hit from enemies without dying).
  .
  Several secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered
  at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode. All of the secondary modes are
  side-scrolling shooters. The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of
  enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other
  bonuses. The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get
  past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss. And, oh
  yeah...don't get crushed by those walls!

description:
  Metal Slug 6 returns to the Rebel-Martian alliance featured in Metal Slugs 2, X,
  and 3, but on a much broader scale. Rather than repeating the previous games'
  events of the Martians breaking the alliance and the Rebels assisting the player
  in turn, the player now teams up with the Rebels and Martians to combat an even
  greater threat.
  .
  Metal Slug 6 introduces a new play mechanic dubbed the 'Weapon Stock System'.
  Two gun power-ups can now be carried at the same time. Players can switch
  between the two weapons, or simply put them both away in favor of the default
  weapon. When obtaining a new weapon power-up, it will automatically occupy the
  inactive slot, or, if both are holstered, replace the less recent weapon of the
  two.\n
  The score is now multiplied by powers of 2. The faster the speed at which
  enemies are killed, the higher the power, as a meter at the bottom of the screen
  shows. When it says "Max" enemies and destructible objects will drop coins for
  an extra high score.

  .
  Blast bugs and mushrooms with your cannon in this sequel to Centipede.
  .
  Defend yourself from hordes of larger-than-life insects. The bugs keep coming --
  all kinds -- and the challenge continues while the intensity increases.
  .
  Armed only with a bow and arrows, you, as the "Archer", must fire through
  through a garden of enormous mushrooms to hit the giant millipede who steadily
  crawls right toward you. Single heads shoot out from the sides of the play
  field!
  .
  Spiders, earwigs, inchworms and beetles appear to wreak their own special havoc
  and then suddenly the screen is filled with waves of bombing bees, dragonflies
  and mosquitoes! Your only chance is to explode one of the DDT bombs!
  .
  Although this game utilizes the same format and controls as Centipede, Millipede
  offers many extra elements that test your skill limits. You still shoot from the
  bottom of the screen at a field of mushrooms, but instead of battling the
  original four insects, you now face a deadlier variety of enemy bugs:
  millipedes, spiders, bees, beetles, earwigs, inchworms, dragonflies, and
  mosquitoes. Naturally, each of these insects has unique characteristics that
  must be studied.\n
  Fortunately, there is a new feature that can be used to the player's advantage:
  DDT bombs. Four of them can appear on the playfield at any given time. Shooting
  one of them unleashes a cloud of deadly gas that destroys any insects, flowers
  or mushrooms in the area. After every few levels a swarm of insects appears, the
  point value for each insect shot during the swarm increases by 100 points up to
  1000 points. Another feature is the option to start at a higher level of
  difficulty, which progresses as the player scores more points similar to
  Tempest.
  .
  The game's original or working title was "Centipede Deluxe".

description:
  Motos is an arcade game, that was released by Namco in 1985. It was the last of
  the 7 games from the company to run on the Super Pac-Man hardware (two Motorola
  M6809 microprocessors running at 1.536 MHz), but with a video system similar to
  that used in Mappy, The Tower of Druaga, Grobda (minus the DAC) and Dig Dug II.
  It was also their last 8-bit game to use a vertical-orientated monitor.
  .
  .
  The player must take control of the eponymous Motos, a bumper car whose goal is
  to force enemies over the edge of the playfield, by bumping up against them;
  however, all the enemies are capable of doing exactly the same thing to it.
  "Power parts" and "jump parts" can also be collected during the 62 rounds, which
  will give Motos extra bumping power, and the ability to jump over gaps in the
  playfield.
  .
  The game was later ported for the Amstrad CPC, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the
  Commodore 64, and the Sharp X68000 - and was later featured in the "Encore"
  edition of their Namco Museum series, for the Sony PlayStation, along with two
  of Namco's Japan-exclusive titles: Wonder Momo (which was to be their last 8-bit
  game in 1986), and Rompers (the key-collecting maze game from 1989). One of the
  enemy characters (the Taitorian) also made an appearance as a bonus character in
  Tinkle Pit (1993).

  In territories outside Japan, the arcade version of Gradius was released under
  the title of Nemesis. The Gradius (Guradiusu, pronounced: Gra-dee-us) games,
  first introduced in 1985, make up a series of scrolling shooter video games
  published by Konami.
  .
  The first true Gradius game introduced the concept of the 'weapon bar'. During
  the game, many enemy craft leave behind icons or 'pick ups' when destroyed.
  Collecting one of these will shift the section cursor along the weapon bar at
  the bottom of the screen. The player can then select the weapon highlighted if
  they want it. The cursor then resets. In general, the more useful 'power ups'
  are towards the right hand side of the bar, so the player may decide to stock up
  on pickups until the better item is available. This innovation allowed for
  deeper tactics on the part of the player and for greater freedom of weapon
  choice rather than relying on the pre-determined power ups common in other games
  in the genre.

genre: Shooter
description:
  Ozma Wars is a 1979 fixed shooter arcade game, and the very first game developed
  and published by SNK, who were still known as "Shin Nihon Kikaku" at the time.
  The game is also known as the second ever vertical shoot 'em up game, after
  Taito's Space Invaders (which ran on the same arcade hardware), but is also
  additionally known as the first game with disparate "levels". The game is also
  notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy,
  resembling a life bar, a mechanic that has now become common in the majority of
  modern action games. The game allowed the player to refuel energy between each
  level, and it featured a large variety of alien enemies.
  .
  The player controls a space craft which must fend off UFOs, meteors, and comets.
  Instead of lives, the player is given an energy reserve that is constantly
  diminishing; getting hit by the enemy causes gameplay to stop momentarily and a
  large amount of energy is depleted. Every so often, a mothership will appear and
  dock with the player's spacecraft, allowing the energy to be refilled. There are
  3-4 recognizable stages as the game progresses and new enemies begin to appear.
  After these, the mothership will appear, and the cycle starts over; this
  continues indefinitely until the energy reaches zero.
  .
  There are two known bootleg versions of this game called Space Phantoms and
  Solar Flight. In Space Phantoms the player's ship looks like an angel, and the
  enemies appear as different types of insects. Due to the game being monochrome
  and a conversion kit for Space Invaders, many Ozma Wars monitors still utilized
  the Space Invaders color overlay.

developer: Namco

genre: Action
description:
  The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots (also called
  pellets). When all pac-dots are eaten, Pac-Man is taken to the next stage.
  Between some stages one of three intermission animations plays. Four enemies
  (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde) roam the maze, trying to catch Pac-Man. If an
  enemy touches Pac-Man, a life is lost and the Pac-Man itself withers and dies.
  When all lives have been lost, the game ends. Pac-Man is awarded a single bonus
  life at 10,000 points by default.
  .
  Near the corners of the maze are four larger, flashing dots known as power
  pellets that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the enemies. The
  enemies turn deep blue, reverse direction and usually move more slowly. When an
  enemy is eaten, its eyes remain and return to the center box where it is
  regenerated in its normal color. Blue enemies flash white to signal that they
  are about to become dangerous again and the length of time for which the enemies
  remain vulnerable varies from one stage to the next, generally becoming shorter
  as the game progresses. In later stages, the enemies go straight to flashing,
  bypassing blue, which means that they can only be eaten for a short amount of
  time, although they still reverse direction when a power pellet is eaten; in
  even later stages, the ghosts do not become edible (i.e., they do not change
  color and still make Pacman lose a life on contact), but they still reverse
  direction.

developer: Capcom
publisher: Capcom

description:
  Pirate Ship Higemaru was produced by Capcom in 1984.
  .
  This is a top-down view arcade game where the player is cast as Japanese sailor
  Momotaro who has to defeat all of the Higemaru pirates as well as their
  nefarious captain Bow.
  .
  Each stage is a fixed screen view of a pirate ship filled with barrels, oil
  drums, bags and more where Momotaro has to take out a set number of pirates (and
  a captain) before moving on to the next level. Momotaro has no weapon of his
  own, so he has to pick up the various barrels and items on the level and throw
  them at the pirates. Some items break on impact, while others are indestructible
  and can be used more than once. If Momotaro manages to throw a rolling barrel
  which hits more than one pirate in succession, the score gets higher for each
  pirate defeated. Some of the barrels and items hide point bonuses and for each
  sixteenth barrel destroyed, an invincibility bonus is rewarded to the player
  which lasts for a short while. The enemies themselves will kill Momotaro by
  touching him, so staying away is a must to survive.
  .
  Each fourth level is a bonus level of sorts where breaking barrels yields
  increasing points, and there is a set number of Bow captains to defeat. After
  level 16, the game will start over from the beginning again, making it a game
  with no ending.

developer: Atari

genre: Fighting
description:
  Pit-Fighter was produced by Atari Games in 1990.
  .
  The game has three different characters of whom each of the players can be:
  Buzz, an ex-professional wrestler Ty, a kick-boxing champion or Kato, a
  third-degree black belt. Each player character has different fighting styles and
  techniques and they also each have their own Super Moves. The opponents are The
  Executioner, Southside Jim, C.C. Rider, Chainman Eddie, Angel, Mad Miles, Heavy
  Metal and The Masked Warrior.\n
  You must defeat all opponents in order to become the champion. The game has 15
  different matches, some opponents like Southside Jim and Angel must each be
  faced twice in respective matches while other opponents are only faced once.
  Before you can make it to The Championship Match to face the reigning champion,
  The Masked Warrior, you must take on two Chainman Eddies. If only one player is
  in the game, there will only be one opponent at a time in most matches, but if
  two or three players are in, there will be two or three opponents at a time in
  each match.
  .
  Between every three matches, there is a Grudge Match where you will attempt to
  knock down your opponent three times without being knocked down three times
  yourself. If only one player is in the game, the opponent will be a
  computer-controlled clone of the character the player is controlling, but if two
  or three players are in the game, they will have to fight each other until the
  last of them remains standing. If the player wins the Grudge Match, a bonus is
  awarded. If not, no bonus.
  .
  In later matches, there are weapons and objects that can be used to fight
  against the opponents including knives, spiked balls, barrels, oil drums,
  crates, sticks, motorcycles, bar stools and so on. Those weapons and objects can
  also be used by the opponents, too. Also, on later stages, there are power pills
  that can temporarily make both the players and the opponents more powerful and
  more difficult to hurt.
  .
  If two or three players are in the game during the last match against the two
  Chainman Eddies before The Champioship Match, after they get past that one, they
  will have to fight each other until there is only one remaining to be standing
  because only one of them will proceed to The Championship Match. Once a player
  has made it to The Championship Match, the player must then face The Masked
  Warrior and then try to defeat him to win the championship. After this, the game
  ends. The attract mode music is generally considered to be annoying.

  thirteenth row which is not visible is also used for storing balls and is
  counted for scoring purposes. The balls drops from the top of the screen in
  linked pairs in the third column, and can be of two types, those with stars and

developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Action
description:
  Pong (marketed as PONG) is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very
  first sports arcade video game. It is a tennis sports game featuring simple
  two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as Computer Space
  came before it, Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream
  popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by
  earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari
  Incorporated (Atari), which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created Pong as a
  training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell
  based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey,
  which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of
  Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture
  the game.
  .
  Pong quickly became a success and is the first commercially successful arcade
  video game machine, which helped to establish the video game industry along with
  the first home console, the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several
  companies began producing games that copied Pong '​s gameplay, and eventually
  released new types of games. As a result, Atari encouraged its staff to produce
  more innovative games. The company released several sequels that built upon the
  original's gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season,
  Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores.
  It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies. The game has been
  remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Pong has
  been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games, and
  has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions.

  all balls gains a 15 second bonus round in which additional points can be

  Rally-X's mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only 10 flags to
  collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend.  In-game
  opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the
  player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than
  the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's
  car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations
  which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display

  Rampage World Tour is a video game released in 1997 and is the second game in
  the Rampage series.
  .
  Rampage World Tour is a updated version of the classic Rampage. Rampage World
  Tour starts off at Scumlabs International where three lab technicians, George,
  Lizzy, and Ralph have mutated in an accident involving toxic waste. George has
  turned into a gigantic ape, Lizzy a gigantic lizard or dinosaur, and Ralph some
  sort of gigantic wolf. The three destroy the lab they previously worked at and
  then embark on a path of destruction encompassing the entire globe.
  .
  The player chooses one of these three characters and begins destroying
  buildings, eating civilians, knocking planes out of the sky, and stepping on
  tanks. The ultimate goal of the game is to rid the world of Scumlabs by
  traveling to the cities where they are located. Being creatures of such massive
  size, there are many cities that must be destroyed along the way. Scumlabs and
  the various militaries make it a priority to destroy you and optionally another
  player that can play simultaneously.
  .
  The graphics are worth noting as they are of a unique, colorful "cartoon"
  flavor. Gameplay includes players climb buildings while punching, kicking, and
  eating their inhabitants to destroy them. Once all the buildings for a
  particular stage have been destroyed, the stage is clear and players proceed to
  the next stage. Players can get many different kinds of power-ups that make them
  more powerful or restore health.

  In a one-player game, the player has to defend his castle from an armada of
  sailing ships. There are two or three types of ships, each type denoted by the
  color and size of the ship. The larger the ship, the more shots it takes to sink
  it.
  .
  A two-player game presents the players a choice of two different game modes:
  .
  A harbor mode where the play area is divided into thirds. Two-thirds of the play
  area is land (one-third for each player), and the last third is dedicated to
  water. At the start of each round, the players are given a number of ships in
  the harbor depending on the amount of land under the player's control.\n
  A river mode where the play area is divided in half by a river. The players use
  their cannons to lay seige to the other player's castle(s).\n
  A three-player game is identical to a two-player game river mode, except that
  the play area is divided into three equal sections by an inverted Y-shaped river

  Red Baron was produced by Atari in 1980.
  .
  In Red Baron, players take on the role of a World War I pilot as they enter the
  cockpit of a triplane during an intense dogfight. Players have to shoot down
  aerial targets like blimps and biplanes and ground targets such as pillboxes and
  tanks. However, continuously shooting can cause their planes guns to temporarily
  overheat so players have to be more judicious with their gunfire. Players also
  have to be careful not to crash into the mountainside they are flying over.
  .
  Shooting both aerial and ground targets will earn the player points. Points for
  destroying objects is always the same except for bi-planes. The farther away
  they are when destroyed the more points they are worth. A bonus plane is earned
  at 2,000, 10,000, and 30,000 points. These points.can also be adjusted to make
  the game more difficult. Other bonus plane points options include the following;
  4,000, 14,000,and 40,000 points or 6,000, 20,000 and 50,000 points, or even the
  option of having no bonus planes at all. Players can also start the game with
  between 2 to 5 planes.
  .
  The game pretty much resembles a plane version of Battlezone.

  RoadBlasters is a futuristic racing action game. The goal is to reach the finish
  line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the
  road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, cannons on the
  side of the road, landmines, and more.
  .
  Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a
  weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected.
  Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has
  a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by
  crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel
  spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies. On many
  levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the
  finish line.

description:
  Satan's Hollow is a fixed screen shoot 'em up that instead of the typical space
  setting of the genre involves fighting the devil and his minions. The gameplay
  is similar to Galaga or Moon Cresta with the enemies (most commonly gargoyles)
  moving around in specific patterns, often diving towards the player. The player
  moves left and right and uses his gun to destroy the enemies. A shield is also
  available and can be activated for a short moment's protection. The shield's
  power is limited and when used up the player has to wait for it to recharge.
  .
  On the right side of the screen is a river of lava and it's the player's task to
  build a bridge over it. A piece of bridge appear on the left side when an enemy
  is killed and the player has to pick it up and transport it to the lava on the
  right. Once the bridge is completed the player can move over it and onto another
  screen where Satan will appear. Satan moves around at a quick pace while
  throwing pitchforks towards the player. When Satan is defeated the player's gun
  gets upgraded with greater fire power and he moves on to the next level with
  tougher enemies and a larger lava river to over bridge.
  .
  The enemies attack in waves that alternate between the common gargoyles that
  move around in formations and the lone devil heads that breaths fire at the
  player. For each wave cleared the player gets a bonus flag which is worth 1000
  extra points and these bonuses are then collected when the player manages to
  defeat Satan. In addition to the regular gargoyles there are also bridge bombers
  that can destroy parts of the bridge if it's hit by a stone and egg throwers
  that throw explosive eggs whose blast radius the player has to stay out of.
  Sometimes gargoyles attempt to steal one of the player's guns (lives) and they
  then have to be shot down before they reach the top.
  .
  The game was ported to the Commodore 64 in 1984.

  Sinibombs are needed to defeat the game boss, Sinistar, an animated spacecraft
  with a demonic skull face. Sinistar does not exist at the start of the game, and
  is continuously under construction by enemy worker ships.

  without releasing any crystals. Enemy worker ships are also gathering crystals
  (often stealing them from the player) which they use to construct the Sinistar.
  Enemy warrior ships can directly attack the player's ship. The player is given a
  head-start before the enemy ships have enough crystals to begin construction.
  .
  Game ends when the player's ships are all destroyed.

  You play a bi-plane pilot on missions to bomb enemy targets. Left to right
  scrolling screen, shoot at enemy planes and trucks. Fly down and pick up the
  bomb as you go along. Cartoon-style graphics and great music.
  .
  A great fun game, features 40 levels of game play with increasing difficulty and
  longer missions, with multiple targets to bomb as you go along. Avoid on-coming
  enemy planes, ground fire and air-balloons. Nice feature in that if you are shot
  down you can hit the loop button repeatedly to get control back of the plane.
  Some hidden bonus features, such as shooting the three dancing girls that appear
  when you complete a mission they turn into flowers. Excellent music and the
  graphics are all in a cartoon style.

description:
  Smash T.V. was produced by Williams Electronic Games, Inc. (WMS, 1985-2000) in
  1990.
  .
  The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an
  ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a
  series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless
  beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight
  and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs,
  fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can
  survive long enough to enjoy them.
  .
  Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of
  Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick
  control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that
  all-important two player mode.

game: Son Son (World) (sonson)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Arcade/Son Son (World) (sonson)/Son Son (World) (sonson).json
developer: Capcom
publisher: Capcom
genre: Platform
description:
  Son Son was produced by Capcom in 1984.
  .
  Son Son and Ton Ton must travel through many different stages fighting against
  Japanese enemies on their way to rescue their friends.
  .
  The game is a 2-D side-scrolling platformer. The screen scrolls automatically,
  only stopping to fight major enemies. The screen features six continuous
  platforms that occasionally feature small gaps. Sonson and Tonton walk
  automatically across these platforms. Pressing up or down will cause them to
  jump up or down to the next platform. Pressing left causes them to move more
  slowly than the screen scrolls, essentially continuing to move forward but at a
  reduced pace. Pressing right does the opposite - SonSon and TonTon will move
  across the platforms faster than the screen scrolls. The duo have only one
  attack - the ability to fire energy blasts from their staves. Touching an enemy
  or an unfriendly projectile causes the player to lose a life. If a player has
  any additional lives, they will return to the screen riding on a cloud that will
  give them temporary invincibility. If the player presses the control stick in
  any direction, the cloud will disappear and the character will resume its usual
  walking mode. The cloud will eventually disappear on its own if the control
  stick is not used.\n
  Power-ups come in the form of various fruits which produce points (with enough
  points giving the player an extra life). Gathering certain fruit will cause all
  enemies currently on a screen to turn into point-bearing fruits. Walking across
  certain platforms will randomly cause a bamboo shoot to sprout, yielding many
  extra points.\n
  It is possible to play the game cooperatively with partner who plays as TonTon
  (who is Zhu Wuneng in the original story).

  It's the 21st century in America. Technology has improved by leaps and bounds,
  and now (most) people live in peace. But in a small town somewhere, a vicious
  terrorist group known as Zapper is terrorizing small towns and kidnapping
  innocent people so that they can build a secret weapon. And, as it turns out,
  the family and friends of someone code-named "Super Joe" just so happened to be
  one of the innocents caught! Now Super Joe's hungry for revenge. Can Super Joe
  and his armored car destroy the Zapper organization and save his town from utter
  destruction in time?
  .
  The Speed Rumbler is a action game where the player races against the clock in
  an armored car piloted by Super Joe, destroying other cars and saving captives
  along the way. Super Joe's car is armed with a gun that he can use to shoot down
  enemy cars, but the enemy cars have a few tricks up their sleeve, so Super Joe
  should always be on guard. As the player progresses through the game's six
  stages, Super Joe can be given a boost by saving captives, who then award him
  with bonus points, increased fire power, or speed-ups. If Super Joe's car is
  destroyed, he can continue the fight on foot with his rifle. But unfortunately,
  Super Joe is not as powerful as his car - one hit and he's history.
  .
  Super Joe has 24 "hours" to destroy Zapper. The game is over when Super Joe runs
  out of lives or time - or if he successfully completes his mission.

  In this game you control a race car on a semi-complicated track. You are

  the track as many times as possible, and as fast as you can. There will be
  eight cars on the track at all times. With the computer controlling cars
  for missing players. The sheer number of cars can make this game a little
  confusing. All the cars have minor variations to set them apart from the
  others, but are similar enough that you simply cannot look away from the
  track for a second. If you are used to the other Sprint games, you will
  find that this one is a bit different, the graphics are slightly higher in
  resolution, and the tracks are much more complex, and have a different look
  to them, not to mention the fact that this version adds a brake pedal that
  was absent in the other Sprint titles. The game has several different
  tracks available, and you can select them with a button at the start of a
  match. The graphics are simple black and white with two shades of gray
  thrown in for good measure. They are simple, but they get the job done.
  The game will rate you at the end, you can get rated Granny, Rookie, or
  Pro, and getting a score over 250 points will extend the game an extra 30
  seconds.

  In Spy Hunter II you control a car racing down a road in third-person
  perspective viewed behind the car, instead of an overhead view as in the
  original game. In this sequel you start with guns as your main weapon and
  accumulate additional weapons like in the original game: oil slick, smoke
  screen, and missiles from the Weapons Van.
  .
  Enemies on the road range from motorcyclists to dune buggies, and air enemies
  consist of dune buggy-style helicopters. Enemies on the road can be taken out
  with your guns and (when obtained from the van) oil slick and smoke screen, but
  the dune buggy copter must be taken out by missiles. The Weapons Van that
  appears periodically, when entered, awards you with a new weapon, and also keeps
  the active vehicle stocked with weapons. The screen displays which weapon is
  active, your score, which gear you are in, and a radar, which helps you to look
  out for oncoming enemies. Damage to your vehicle is represented by bullet holes
  on the screen. Take enough damage, and you lose your vehicle, which bursts in
  flames.
  .
  Gameplay is available with single player, or simultaneous two player, where both
  players play cooperatively. The screen is shared by both players, but split down
  the middle by a bezel (or divider) in front of the screen, and the machine
  cabinet comes equipped with two steering wheels, two gas pedals, gear shifts,
  and buttons for the different weapons.

  Hyper Fighting features faster playing speed compared to Champion Edition. As a
  result, the inputs for special moves and combos requires more precise timing.
  The faster play speed also allowed players to get into battle quicker, as well
  as to counterattack quicker. All of the fighters, with the exception of Guile
  and the four Grand Masters, were each given a new special move, with the
  exception of Chun-Li who was given two.

description:
  An update to this game's prequel that also uses the CPS3 system. Adds three new
  selectable characters including a hidden character, increases the play speed,
  and introduces a few new moves along with damage modifications.
  .
  This is the follow-up to Street Fighter III: New Generation . The brothers Yun
  and Yang are now truly separate characters with different moves, the demonic
  Akuma known from previous Street Fighter installments returns (though not as
  regular part of the roster), and two other new characters are introduced:\n
  - Hugo. A big professional wrestler. His roots lie actually in the Final Fight
  series.\n
  - Urien. The brother of the boss character, Gill. Urien's appearance and moves
  resemble him. While Gill manipulates powers of ice and fire, Urien wields
  lightning and has the ability to make his body metallic.
  .
  There are also some notable additions in terms of gameplay. A player can now
  perform EX Specials, which are powered up versions of the moves at the cost of a
  reduced Super Art gauge. It's possible to escape from a throwing attack, and a
  "Personal Action" grants characters specific benefits (Alex receives more attack
  power for example). Furthermore, there is now a bonus round which tests the
  parrying skill of the player, as Sean throws basketballs towards him which can
  be deflected

  This version of the third series marks the return of Chun Li along with the
  Bonus Rounds.
  .
  This version of Street Fighter III adds five new characters to the rosters such
  as Chun Li (from Street Fighter II), Makoto (a judo expert), Twelve (another
  Gill clone), Q (who resembles a Japanese superhero similar to Tetsujin 28) and
  Remy (a Guile/Nash clone). This game also marks the return of bonus rounds which
  were last present in Super Street Fighter II.
  .
  After choosing a Super Art in a 1-Player game, you'll then be given a choice of
  2 stages to proceed to. As mentioned, earlier, for each stage except the last 2
  stages, you have a choice, out of 2 opponents to fight with. Once you've
  selected who you'll be fighting, the announcer (or someone) will give some
  speech remarks (either "That's what I expect" or something else. It's random),
  and then you'll proceed to fighting the opponents. If you continue, you'll still
  have the same choice of 2 opponents, but you can re-select who to fight. So, if
  you think Opponent 1 is hard to win, you can then go for Opponent 2.
  .
  In the 1-Player game, you have a course of 10 opponents to fight against in
  order to complete the game. Due to constant VS matches, no one had the chance to
  reach that far (I reached Stage 7 before the long VS matches began). However, as
  mentioned earlier, in Stages 9 and 10, you would not have a choice of opponents
  (i.e. fixed opponent depending on your character in Stage 9), and Stage 10
  should be Gill for every character. Your character will have some dialogue with
  your Stage 9 opponent.
  .
  After Stage three and Stage six, you will be given the chance to try out the
  Bonus Stages. After Stage three is the "Crush the Car" Bonus Stage, while after
  Stage 6 is the "Parry the Ball" Bonus Stage. Before the car Bonus Stage, the VS
  screen will show you VS SUV (the name of the van and a picture of it). Then it
  goes like in the SF2 games. However, you don't need to switch sides, as the
  whole car can be destroyed by only 1 side, and you CAN use Super Moves. Although
  the Super Meter is not shown, but it's still accumulated as you do moves.
  Unfortunately, you CAN'T have 2-Player Bonus Stages as in the SF2 games. When
  another player joins in, it just goes straight to the fight.
  .
  The Parry the Ball Bonus Stage (shown as you VS Basketball at the VS screen,
  with Sean's picture holding a Basketball) works something like the one if
  SF3:2I. There are still different levels of it, depending on your performance
  before you reach it. However, there are slight differences. For one, it gets it
  very own background, instead of reusing one of the character backgrounds, and
  you're not just limited to one screen. The background can scroll when you move
  too far away from Sean. Other than that, it works the same, and you have 20
  balls to parry.
  .
  The Grade Judgment System is applied throughout the game. For each stage, you'll
  receive a grade, depending on your performance (mostly stuff like don't lose a
  round, do Super Cancels, do long combos, win with Super Arts, etc. will give you
  a higher grade). And the grade you've obtained for each stage is keep track and
  shown on the list of characters that you've defeated before each stage. At the
  very end (when you don't continue or win), a chart will be shown for all the
  stages and the grades you've obtained for them. Below the grades, there's a bar
  labelled as "SP" and for certain stages, you have a dot on this bar (I suppose
  SP means Super?). There's a high chance that this Grade Judgment System and the
  SP should be a key in unlocking some secret boss...
  .
  In 2-Player battles, you have a separate set of grades. For the player that has
  at least 1 win, the highest grade he/she has obtained will be shown below their
  wins. The more wins they have, the more chances for them to obtain higher grades
  for that match. Once they lose, the grade disappears.
  .
  Parries... It's still in the game, but there are only three versions of it now.
  F on the ground for a high parry, D on the ground for a low parry, and F in the
  air for an air parry (i.e. no D air parry that makes you bounce). Parries still
  work like in the previous versions, but the freeze-time after a parry has been
  shortened slightly. This causes a few changes. One, most players would need to
  relearn parry rhythms for a string of parries (i.e. parrying multi-hit moves),
  and two, you have less time to connect a Super Move after a parry.
  .
  Throws have been changed to LP LK and you have miss animation frames, although
  it's very fast, universal overhead attacks (previously D, D ANY BUTTON in SF3
  and SF3:2I) are now MP MK, while taunts are still HP HK. Throws need to be
  re-learned once again. Depending on the character, you can have several
  different throws, depending on whether you press LP LK when you're holding B, F
  or NEUTRAL. MP MK for universal overhead attacks still works the same way, and
  the taunt is still the same. The characters still have dashes(F, F or B, B),
  high jumps (D, U), long jumps (DB, UF), quick stand (D when hitting the floor),
  and Super Cancels.

  A one-on-one fighting game. There are eight characters to choose from including
  twins with the same abilities and a very annoying boss. The game has smoother

  The long awaited sequel to Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, this game
  features the not-so-unexpected return of Ryu and Ken plus a new generation of
  street fighters.
  .
  Air-blocking and taunts from the Alpha series have been replaced by parrying. To
  parry a hit, you increase your super meter, but not the attacker's. This
  technique, called "offensive blocking" is performed by hitting towards your
  opponent just before you get hit.
  .
  The only returning characters are Ken and Ryu, the rest are new. However, some
  of the new characters are related to the old ones. Sean is Ken's pupil, Yang and
  Yun are Gen's grandsons and Ibuki is rumored to be the daughter of Geki (a ninja
  from the original Street Fighter). Some characters have fighting styles similar
  to some of the older characters.

  Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new
  game variations. Your goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying
  the bricks at the top of the playfield. To do this, you need to use the paddle
  at the bottom of the screen to keep a bouncing ball within the playfield. There
  are four different game variations included. The first is 'Breakout', and plays
  the same as the original game.
  .
  This leaves three new gameplay concepts. In 'Progressive' the brick walls will
  slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively
  faster and faster. When there's room, a new layer of bricks will appear at the
  top.
  .
  The other two games add a second paddle. In 'Double Breakout' you have two balls
  to keep in play and score with. In 'Cavity' there is a single ball in play when
  you start, but two additional balls trapped within the bricks. These are freed
  when their surrounding bricks are destroyed.

  Sunday evening. You're sitting around the sewer watching your main reporter,
  April O'Neil do a live remote from the Statue of Liberty. Then it happens.

  her foundation, sending hundreds of freaked out tourists into the harbor below.
  "No way!" cries Raphael. "Way," replies Donatello. And the crazy quantum chase
  is on! Journey through multiple levels of enormous graphics, the largest and
  craziest talking Turtles ever with eons of bodacious battlegrounds, from
  prehistoric to futuristic galaxies. Get ready for the 3-D jab and toss that
  sends enemies flying right in your face. Mondo body slams and pizza power

genre: Platform
description:
  You control a logger, who must chop down trees as they spring up. Two indicators
  appear at the top of the screen; the left tells you how many trees you must chop
  to clear the level, and the right tells you how much time you have left.
  .
  The boss is watching you, so you must chop down the trees quickly; to earn
  points for each tree, and bonus points for chopping all the trees needed for
  that level with time remaining. If a bird falls out of a tree you chop down,
  grabbing the bird before it gets away will earn you bonus points. You must avoid
  allowing a tree to fall on you; if it does, you will be stunned briefly, using
  up valuable time. A bear appears at a higher level, who will periodically throw
  beehives at you that releases bees, which you must avoid. A bonus level features
  maintaining your balance on a floating log that spins back and forth, which you
  must balance until the timer runs out to receive additional points.
  .
  You may play with a second player simultaneously, where you may either play
  cooperatively, or competitively. After chopping a tree before it falls (or after
  the other player chops the tree), it may be pushed down on the other player,
  instead of letting it fall down, if the player(s) choose to play competitively,
  The player with the higher tree count receives bonus points, and the other
  player is subjected to abuse from the boss.
  .
  Levels become more difficult as you progress, with additional trees to cut down,
  and additional time added on the timer. A player loses a life if the logger gets
  hit by a beehive releasing bees that sting you, or if you fail to chop down all
  of the trees when the timer runs out (the boss will blow the whistle if this
  happens). The game is over when you lose all of your loggers.
  .
  After every two levels is a bonus round where you must stay on a rolling log as
  long as possible.

description:
  Two guys on inner-tubes ride down a river throwing cans at things and avoiding
  obstacles to gain points. When you complete a level you get a beach party thrown
  in your name and the party gets bigger as you progress. Great music and gameplay
  combine for a fun two player game.
  .
  You are in a river race pitted against the computer or another player. Outscore
  your opponent by swishing the gates, hitting obstacles and other game characters
  with cans, collecting hidden letters to spell Toobin', and collecting
  treasures.\n
  The player characters are Bif and Jet. Whenever there is only one player in the
  game, there will be a computer-controlled opponent called Flotsam.
  .
  The game has three different classes, each with five rivers, for a total of 15.
  When you reach class 4 it repeats the classes until the last class of the game:
  number 6. The rivers in each class are as follows:
  .
  Colorado, Amazon, Okeefenokee, American and Nile\n
  Yukon, Argentum, Left Bank, Cuprum and Canals Of Mars\n
  Jurassic, Black Forest, Rio Grande, Styx and Nightmare
  .
  Collect as many points as possible and try to push your opponent into obstacles.
  Swish up to five gates in a row and you will correspondingly advance your score
  multiplier (very important). Basic gates start at 2000, 1000, 500, 250. Once
  passed through the gates will decrease in points until they reach 100. Swishing
  a gate and then bumping it numerous times before your opponent can pass is an
  effective move. Pick-up cans (you can carry up to 9 at a time) or a sixpack
  (which gives you unlimited cans). The cans are used as "ammo" to hinder your
  opponent, stun other game characters, or to destroy certain obstacles (some
  obstacles are only temporarily destroyed). When you have a blowout you lose your
  sixpack and your score multiplier resets to 1. Your multiplier will go down each
  time you miss a gate.\n
  Obstacles in the water (icebergs, bushes, mines, etc.) can reveal hidden points,
  sixpacks, patches(extra life), beachballs(speedup), including the fabled
  colorful letters. These letters are worth 10,000 points a piece. Try to have
  your score multiplier as high as possible to maximize the letter bonus at the
  end of each class. Be on the lookout for the 25,000 point gate since swishing it
  can give you up to 125,000 points if your score multiplier is 5! Unlike the
  other gates however, you only get one chance at the 25,000. Also be on the
  lookout for falling rocks, jumping penguins, submarines with nasty torpedoes,
  etc. On the first and second start gate you can utilize the warp whirlpool that
  will send you to a higher class. Many non-player characters chase you along the
  way. Watch out for the alligator, he likes to come out when you stall and he
  always comes from the top of the screen. You must go through a gate to repel
  that alligator before he appears or before he gets you.

  disaster that befalls a human colony on a planet of the same name. The entire
  colony is run by a 7th generation supercomputer which controls the operations of
  all machinery on the planet. Unfortunately for the residents of Varth, Delta-7
  has been possessed by the entity "DUO" (Dimension Unbody Offender), thought of
  as an evil spirit but actually a temporal-spatial consciousness which
  spontaneously arose within the supercomputer. DUO has come to the conclusion
  that human existence is inimical to the planet, and has therefore turned the
  planet's defenses against its own populace. Eighty percent of the planet is laid
  waste by the event, and this is only the beginning of DUO's cleansing scheme.
  The colonists' reliance on the supercomputer has caused them to lose the ability
  to take care of themselves, and thus have no means of fighting back. The only
  hope for the colony lies in the pilots of two planes equipped with 4th
  generation computers which DUO cannot control—they are controlled not by
  machinery, but by humans.

  gameplay commenced. Also, when the player loses a life, upon coming one would
  hear "Come on, let's fight!".

game: Vulcan Venture (World) (vulcan)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Arcade/Vulcan Venture (World) (vulcan)/Vulcan Venture (World) (vulcan).json
developer: Konami
publisher: Konami
genre: Shooter
description:
  The player returns as the role of the pilot of the Vic Viper spaceship to battle
  the second onslaughts of the Bacterion Empire, under the new leadership of
  Gofer, the giant head. Gradius II has kept the gameplay from the original game,
  but infused it with enhancements brought from the spin-off, Salamander (Life
  Force). This is primarily evident in two of the weapons configurations that are
  selectable. Another first in the series was the inclusion of the "boss rush"
  (also known as "boss parade" or "boss alley"), a level designed entirely with
  only boss confrontations.
  .
  Gradius II retains the selection bar from Gradius, but now the player can choose
  between four different weapon configurations and progressions. All schemes have
  speed-up and multiples (Options), but have differing 'Missile', 'Double'
  (laser), and 'Laser' weapons. The player can have at most four multiples.
  Additionally, there are also two types of shielding to choose from: shield and
  forcefield. The shield option adds more durability, but only for the front of
  the Vic Viper, while the forcefield adds protection for the entire spacecraft,
  albeit only against three hits. In the Famicom version, choosing another
  multiple after four will make the four multiples to move around the spacecraft
  for 16 seconds; force field is the only shielding available for protection of
  the entire spacecraft, withstanding three hits and it is included in four
  different weapon configurations and progressions; and 'Double' and 'Laser' have
  to be activated twice to achieve full performance.

game: Warlords! (World) (warlords)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Arcade/Warlords! (World) (warlords)/Warlords! (World) (warlords).json
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Action
description:
  The players use shields to defend their castle walls from the fireballs that
  ricochet around the playfield. Players can capture and catapult the fireballs at
  opposing castles. Fireballs destroy pieces of the castle walls they hit.
  .
  The objective of the game is to destroy the three other castles while protecting
  one's own castle with the moving shield. When the button is depressed, the
  shield can capture a fireball. Release the button and the fireball is catapulted
  at the opponents. The spinning fireballs released from a shield have more
  destructive force on a castle wall than a fireball simply deflected from another
  wall or the sides of the playfield. Fireballs cannot be held long since they
  slowly destroy the player's own castle walls adjacent to the fireball.
  Additional fireballs appear at predetermined intervals or when a castle is
  destroyed, whichever comes first. A maximum of four fireballs can simultaneously
  be in play.\n
  The computer controls all the unpaid castles. In one- and two-player games, if a
  paid player has the surviving castle, the game continues with a new battle at a
  higher level. In the higher levels, computer opponents play more accurately and
  faster. Two-player games can be played jointly to maximize score/level or
  competitively.
  .
  Atari also ported their game to their popular 2600/VCS home console in 1981.

developer: Capcom
publisher: Capcom
genre: Fighting
description:
  Warriors of Fate is a beat'em up with nine stages. Each contains large mobs
  including spearman, archers, strongmen, bomb-wielding opponents, and at least
  one boss. Using two buttons, Attack and Jump, the characters all have standard
  moves typical of Capcom side-scrollers of the day.
  .
  There is also a variety of weapons in the game which can be picked up. As with
  most side-scrollers, food is used to replenish health and can be found in
  various breakable containers in the game level. One notable feature of the game
  is the ability to summon a warhorse which adds more attacks to the characters,
  generally involving pole-arms. Most characters are given a special wrestling
  throw of their own, like in Final Fight and The Punisher.
  .
  In the Japanese version, the game follows Liu Bei's plight in Jingzhou from the
  Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a history-based novel from China, set in the
  Three Kingdoms period as Cao Cao sets to invade his lands. In the English
  adaptation, however, the Three Kingdoms theme was lost, and most names have been
  changed to names of Mongolian origin.

developer: Dave Nutting Associates
publisher: Midway
genre: Shooter
description:
  The players' characters, called Worriors, must kill all the monsters by shooting
  them. Player one has yellow Worriors, on the right, and player two has blue
  Worriors, on the left. In a two-player game, the players are also able to shoot
  each other's Worriors, earning bonus points and causing the other player to lose
  a life. Team-oriented players can successfully advance through the game by
  standing back-to-back (such as in a corner) and firing at anything that comes at
  them.
  .
  Each dungeon consists of a single-screen rectangular grid with walls and
  corridors in various formations. The Worriors and the monsters can travel freely
  through the corridors. Each dungeon has doors at the left and right edges, which
  connect with each other, making the dungeon wrap around. Whenever a door is
  traversed by a player or monster, both of them deactivate for a short period,
  making them impassable. A player who exits the door can pop back through the
  door immediately when the Worluk or Wizard is in the dungeon. A small radar
  display indicates the positions of all active monsters.

  Yie Ar Kung-Fu (Chinese: 一二功夫; pinyin: yī èr gōng fū; literally "One Two Kung
  Fu"; "Yie Ar" is pronounced "ee-ar") features the hero, Oolong (written 烏龍
  Wūlóng, and ウーロン Ūron in Japanese), controlled by the player. Oolong must fight
  all the martial arts masters given by the game (11 in the arcade version; five
  to 13 in the home ports) unarmed to win the title of "Grand Master" and honor
  the memory of his father. On his side is a variety of punch and kick blows
  reachable by combining the joystick with one of the buttons (punch or kick). He
  also has the greatest jumping ability of all the game's fighters, with the
  exception of "Blues".\n
  The player faces a variety of opponents, each with a unique appearance and
  fighting style. The player can perform up to 16 different moves, using a
  combination of buttons and joystick movements while standing, crouching or
  jumping. Moves are thrown at high, middle, and low levels. Regardless of the
  move that defeated them, male characters (save Feedle) always fall unconscious
  lying on their backs with their legs apart (players flail their feet), and
  female characters always fall demurely lying on their sides. Feedle disappears.
  There are only two female fighters, and the rest are male. When a player gains
  an extra life, the word "xiè xiè" (Mandarin Chinese for "thank you") is heard.
