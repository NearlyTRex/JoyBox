description:
  Star Hearts is a WonderSwan Color exclusive fantasy action role-playing game set
  in the fictional world of Uras, which has a large floating fortress in the
  center. The protagonist is selectable by the player at the beginning of the
  game, either the boy or the girl depicted on the front cover, together with some
  input such as the name, date of birth, and a blood type. The story starts with
  the player character about to become the new village chief. The ceremony gets
  interrupted by a bunch of attacking monsters and the hero barely escapes with
  their life.
  .
  The game uses a 3/4 view where the player moves in a vertical and horizontal
  way, can interact with other NPCs and fight enemies on the screen using
  projectiles or blunt weapons. Fighting is done in real-time, and after battling
  many weaker enemies, one will usually face a boss. While the player starts the
  game alone, they will get a pet companion, choosable out of four different
  types, in the middle of the journey. Leveling up is not done through gaining
  experience from combat, but instead by finding fairies scattered around the
  land.
