game: Resident Evil 2 (USA)

developer: Tiger Electronics, Ltd

genre: Horror

  Following the release of the original PlayStation edition Resident Evil 2 in
  January 1998, Tiger Electronics released a sprite-based 2.5D version for their
  Game.com handheld in late 1998. It included only Leon Kennedy's story path, and
  removed several of the original game's core features.\n
  Having been developed for a woefully under-powered console, it lacks much of
  what defined the original game. It can be seen as attempting to boil Resident
  Evil 2 down to its bare essentials: Killing zombies and collecting items.
  However, with the poor framerate and lack of visual fidelity afforded by the
  Game.com, it fails even in this regard. Despite this, it is known as one of the
  best games for the Tiger Game.com.
  .
  In the history of the franchise, it is the first game to be rated "T" for Teen
  by the ESRB, as opposed to the more typical "M" for Mature. This rating can be
  attributed to the Game.com's inability to render the same level of graphic
  violence as the original game.
