  A bullet hell that constantly grows more intense.

  Trails

  Collect spheres to grow longer than your opponents. Block their path and pay
  attention to your own, similar to Snake or Achtung die Kurve / Zatacka. On top
  of that, you also have the ability to shoot with your own spheres.
  .
  Blizzard (Teams)
  .
  Think Pong. But you play in teams, can roam freely on your side of the court,
  and have to defend against a whole shower of spheres at once.

  How to play
  .
  You're moving pieces around the board, using abilities (on the little cards on
  the bottom) and gaining as many Cool Points as you can before the day is over.
  There are currently about a dozen or so different pieces in the game, and each
  party locale has its own special rules and features.
  .
  Tap on a unit to find out where it can move to. Then you can click one of the
  destinations to move it there.
  .
  When a unit is selected, you can also see its abilities on the bottom of the
  screen. If you use an ability, you have to wait a few turns before you can use
  it again - this is called a "cooldown". Wait a few more turns and then try
  again.
  .
  Songs and Playlists
  .
  You start with 2 songs unlocked, but as you gain more stars, more will be
  unlocked. Each song does a different thing passively as you play (you can click
  the Karaoke machine to remind you just what the song's a-doin').
  .
  Probably some songs go good with some kinds of units or something, but you
  probably will also just have your favorite songs. Try stuff out!

game: Codemancer (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Google Android/Codemancer (USA)/Codemancer (USA).json
developer: Important Little Games
publisher: Important Little Games
genre: Educational;Puzzle
description:
  Codemancer brings the mystery of magic and the exhilaration of learning to code
  together in a fantasy universe that uses spell casting as a way to teach and
  learn programming skills. Codemancer's fantasy universe is filled with rival
  sorcerers and their minions for players to encounter along their journey.
  Codemancer is a non-violent, entertaining, and educational game designed to be
  inclusive and accessible to learners at any stage. Features include a gender-
  neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and a
  programming interface that's designed to be easy to understand by kids with
  varying degrees of skill and experience. Codemancer breaks down barriers that
  may have discouraged some kids from embracing technology and elevates their
  screentime to be more productive and entertaining.  It isn't a typical coding or
  technology game.
  .
  WHAT IS CODEMANCER ALL ABOUT?
  .
  Codemancer tells a moving story about Aurora, a young, creatively talented girl
  who's trying to grow up, become independent, and do good in the world in the
  face of incredible obstacles when her father is suddenly kidnapped. Aurora has
  to embark on an adventure to save him as she grows into a gracious and
  independent young woman. She must learn magic spells to save her father, but the
  magic used in Aurora's world works the same as programming does in ours. Inspire
  children to explore their potential as they discover the magic of coding.
  .
  CODEMANCER IS AN EDUCATIONAL GAMING ADVENTURE:
  .
  Codemancer is designed for 6 to 12 year olds as an educational game that teaches
  the magic behind coding-and can be fun for grownups, too!
  .
  CODEMANCER SPECIFICALLY TEACHES:
  .
  Sequential Algorithms
  .
  Debugging
  .
  Function Arguments
  .
  Scope
  .
  Looping Constructs
  .
  Concurrent Programming
  .
  ...AND TEACHES IN GENERAL:
  .
  Computational Thinking
  .
  Planning
  .
  Problem Solving
  .
  Resilience
  .
  CODEMANCER FEATURES:
  .
  A narrative inspired by popular works of young adult fantasy worlds such as
  Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Neverending Story, The Last Airbender, and many
  more!
  .
  Gameplay that takes place in a hexagonal world, making it easy to estimate
  distances and angles by eye.
  .
  'Freeze time' ability, so players can debug the programs they've written and
  potentially code their way out of a jam to learn from their mistakes.
  .
  Availability for PC, Mac, iPad, and Android tablets.
  .
  CODEMANCER IS STRUCTURED FOR ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSIVITY:
  .
  The goal of Codemancer is to be as broadly inclusive as possible by creating a
  gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone,
  and language interface that's designed to make the game appeal to kids at
  different skill levels.
  .
  Codemancer breaks down barriers that can hinder some kids from feeling
  comfortable with engaging with programming, for example Codemancer uses pips
  (like on a die) instead of numerals, and sets the gameplay in a hexagonal world
  that makes it easy to estimate distances and angles by eye.
  .
  No syntax errors -- if you can enter a spell, it will run. Syntax errors can be
  frustrating and cause learners to quit before they really begin.
  .
  Codemancer uses an open dyslexic font, where letters are designed to look
  distinctly different from each other to make reading easier for kids with
  dyslexia.
  .
  The game is fully voiced, so reading is completely optional.
  .
  Codemancer's programming language is designed to be accessible, but also
  translates easily to a variety of popular real-world programming languages (such
  as Python).
  .
  Codemancer appeals to many educational groups, from children with special needs
  for reading, to younger children new to coding, to older children with more
  advanced coding and programming skill sets.
  .
  Codemancer has the potential to reach under-represented groups in coding and
  teach them an often-exclusionary, but nonetheless important, 20th-century skill.

game: Crayon Physics Deluxe (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Google Android/Crayon Physics Deluxe (USA)/Crayon Physics Deluxe (USA).json
developer: Kloonigames
publisher: Hudson Soft
genre: Puzzle;General
description:
  Crayon Physics Deluxe is the full game that was developed out of the Crayon
  Physics prototype. It is a puzzle game of crayons and physics. The goal for
  each of the 80 levels is to move a red ball so it hits one or more yellow
  stars. The mouse (or a tablet PC) is used to draw physical objects of
  different colours which can move the ball, block it or provide a bridge. The
  objects interact with each other as well as with the environment. The left
  mouse button is used to draw, and the right one to erase objects. When the
  ball falls off the screen, it reappears at its original relocation. It is
  also possible to reset an entire level. The game is played against a scrap
  paper background and all objects have a crayon art style.
  .
  The most important change is that the puzzles are now shown as areas on
  different islands. From the overview map, the player can travel to different
  locations and try levels. For each won level, the number of stars is added
  up. When an entire island has been completed, it is possible to travel
  between eight different islands to try a new set, provided that a sufficient
  amount of stars has been collected. Islands that require many stars also
  provide more difficult levels and player can choose to skip a level to solve
  it later.
  .
  Even though the basic concept has not been changed, the physics model has
  been vastly improved. More types of shapes can be drawn and there are pins to
  connect them, which opens up the possibility to draw objects that act like
  hammers that swing down to kick the ball. The mouse wheel is used to change
  the colour of the lines and there are much more levels with different themes
  and variations. A new function allows the player to nudge the ball a little
  to the left or the right, but it has a reloading instance so that it cannot
  be used constantly.
  .
  A level editor is included to design custom levels and these can be
  uploaded to a playground. When registered, it is possible to download and
  play custom levels designed by other users.

developer: Hassey Enterprises, Inc.
publisher: Hassey Enterprises, Inc.
genre: Action
description:
  Dynamite Jack is an almost top-down shooter about the space marine Jack. He
  was captured and forced to work in the Anathema Mines, but now he has a
  chance to escape, armed only with a flashlight and bombs. To reach the
  surface he has to move up 26 levels, sneaking past enemies or blowing them
  up, to open up the entrances that bring him to a new environment.
  .
  Each level is set in a maze-like environment where the exit needs to be
  located. Jack starts unarmed but the first item he usually gets to pick up is
  a flashlight. It is used to navigate dark passages but makes him more visible
  to opponents. The only means of offence is the bomb. Once a detonator has
  been picked up Jack can put down an unlimited amount of bombs, but only one
  at a time. They are dropped Bomberman-style and are detonated with a second
  key press. Enemies are oblivious to bombs that have not been detonated yet so
  generally their movement patterns need to be studied to drop a bomb in their
  path. Bombs are also used to blow up rocks in the environment to create a
  custom route. Certain parts of the levels are metal structures and those
  cannot be blown up.
  .
  The default enemies have a visible line of sight that needs to be used by the
  player in the vein of the Commandos series. Not all enemies need to be
  defeated, it is also often possible to sneak past them. The sound of bombs
  attracts the attention of enemies and this can also be used to Jack's
  advantage to lure them away. Most enemies carry guns and a single bullet
  kills Jack. Blue cubes scattered around the levels are used as quick save
  spots. More advanced levels have energy sources that need to be blown up and
  different key cards. To progress hidden data sets needs to be collect to open
  up additional maps.
  .
  The in-game map can be consulted at any time and it shows all locations Jack
  has visited with visual cues for enemies and other important elements. The
  game includes an editor to build custom levels and share them with other
  players. There is a map browser to play maps made available by other players
  directly from the game.

genre: Strategy
description:
  Feud is a turn-based strategy game made by some guys you haven't heard of yet.
  Originally a board game designed by Dave Cordell, it's been polished and tweaked
  and generally mucked about with to bring it to the glowing screen you're reading
  this description on. Unless you printed it out? Think of the trees. Please.
  .
  Condensed abstract strategy!
  .
  Imagine chess, but on a four-by-four grid, where pieces are swapped rather than
  moved, each piece has its own special ability and--
  .
  OK, not so much like chess. What you can expect is a highly condensed little
  abstract strategy game which is easy enough to learn but quite tricky to get
  good at. The AI still beats us sometimes. The computers are winning. Please get
  good at Feud so we can beat them.
  .
  Cross-platform!
  .
  Feud has full cross-platform play between PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. This
  means you can play Feud at your boring job, then on the bus on the way home from
  your boring job, then on your computer at home while you recover from your
  boring job.
  .
  Please note that we do not recommend playing Feud during your commute if you
  walk to work, especially if you live in a city with lots of open manhole covers
  which is pretty much what I imagine New York to be like. I dunno, I've never
  been.
  .
  You haven't told me much about this game yet, to be honest!
  .
  I'm not very good at this. Sorry. Anyway, look, the game's pay-whatever and only
  a couple of hundred megabytes. You might as well, really.

developer: Ice-Pick Lodge Ltd.

genre: Action
description:
  There is a cabin in the woods that serves as a laboratory and a dwelling for
  a Lodger. Lately the Lodger experiences strange changes in the surroundings -
  each night some things get missing, noises are heard and mysterious guests
  are coming from the woods. The Lodger is insomniac and he needs to stay awake
  and sane till dawn. He also has lost something important, something that may
  be the reason of all the strange events.
  .
  At its heart Knock-knock! is a hide-and-seek game. Each level (or night) is
  timed and all you need to do is wait till the morning comes. The way you do
  it is up to you, the player. You may roam around the house and investigate
  what's going on - turning on the lights and unlocking doors. You may choose
  to "fill in the gaps" - make certain things appear in the lit rooms. When
  bizarre "guests" start appearing in your house you may try to close the
  "portals" from which they come or you may choose to hide behind the bed and
  hope they don't spot you. From time to time you will leave your dwelling and
  find yourself in the woods or in a seemingly endless corridor. The story of
  the Lodger is told in strange messages that you find and by the Lodger
  himself at certain moments. At some points the rules of the game may slightly
  change and it is up to the player to understand what has changed and why.
  Some of your actions will determine the outcome of the story and alter your
  understanding of what's going on.

  records!

  hit, but you may want to be quick, because as time goes by the moles start
  popping more and more often!
  .
  The second style would be the Lover style. The Lover mole is a mole who loves
  hearts and he'll do anything to get one, and every time you forget to hit a
  mole, a heart will pop up, so if you don't stop him, he will get it for him and
  you will lose one of yours! Try not to lose all three!
  .
  The third style would be the Devil! You are on a deadline and every time you
  don't hit a mole you'll have even less time to play! So be fast and don't let
  any mole get away so that you can play as long you can!

genre: Simulation
description:
  Monster Loves You is an interactive fiction with graphics life simulator,
  where the player lives the life of a monster in the village of Omen —
  starting from the monster brooding pool, adolescence, adulthood, and, if it
  survives, elderhood — and may affect the world of monsters and humans.
  .
  Gameplay consists of decision making choices the player must make to
  determine the life course of the monster. These choices will affect
  attributes the monster has: bravery, ferocity, cleverness, honesty, and
  kindness. Including an invisible attribute: neurosurgery. Decisions made will
  either increase or decrease these attributes (e.g. +9 Ferocity), which in
  return will also affect the success rate of future choices since adulthood.
  .
  When monster reaches adulthood, reputation comes into play, which may affect
  the monster's chances of becoming an elder. Failing to become an elder may
  mean certain death. Chances of success will greatly depend on the overall
  attributes and reputation the monster has accumulated throughout the game. If
  the monster successfully becomes an elder, it now has the choice to affect
  the lives and relations between monsters and humans. To coexist peacefully,
  destroy the humans or other alternatives are entirely up to the player.
  .
  Finishing the game will unlock medals (achievements) commemorating the
  accomplishments the player has made.

developer: Nicalis, Inc.
publisher: Nicalis, Inc.
genre: Action;Puzzle
description:
  In NightSky a boy finds a glowing sphere on the beach. He brings it home, but
  ever since finding it he has the strangest dreams at night. The player acts
  out these dreams in surreal environments, controlling the ball. The game
  combines the ambient aesthetics of the Knytt series with the ball mechanic
  from Within a Deep Forest. Players guide the ball through different worlds,
  but with more linear gameplay than the aforementioned titles, solving
  puzzles to progress.
  .
  The ball can be moved left or right and using the appropriate speed it is
  possible to travel over gaps or climb ramps. Levels gradually introduce more
  difficult challenges often based on physics. The ball for instance needs to
  ride a cart, pass a windmill or use flippers like in a pinball machine to
  reach a higher area. There are also two main powers that can be applied to
  the ball, but these are not available at all times. The first gives the ball
  a red glow and offers more precise control. The player can brake more
  quickly and slightly stick to surfaces. The second gives off a blue glow and
  offers additional speed. Players use it to climb slopes more quickly or
  traverse wider gaps. In certain section the blue glow reverses gravity (and
  the controls along with it). The game has an ambient atmosphere and there
  are no enemies, bosses or any form of violence.
  .
  There are eleven worlds in total, each with a different theme and new
  challenges. To progress the player simply needs to reach the next screen each
  time. The game is saved automatically, but not after every single screen.
  Certain challenges are divided over multiple screens (often three) and then
  the game is only saved after the section is entirely completed. It is
  possible to misinterpret a puzzle, get stuck, and reset the environment.
  .
  There are two difficulty levels. "Normal" is aimed at casual players with
  minor puzzle elements, similar in difficulty to most of Nicklas Nygren's
  previous games, while "Alternative" has complicated puzzles, minimal
  instructions, and demands more thought and precise control of the ball.
  In both game modes levels are largely the same.

  Introducing the COMPLETE STORY of "Seduce Me", the popular English Dating Sim
  where you get to tell your story with a family of five demon brothers from the
  moment you meet the incubi to the day you say I do to your favorite incubus.
  This Complete Story includes "Seduce Me The Otome", "Seduce Me 2: The Demon
  War", 13 mini-episodes, and both Audio Otome CDs as well as a basic compendium
  for lore comprehension!
  .
  "It seemed like the start of something new. Something that would change."
  .
  You are a senior in high school along with your two best friends, Naomi
  Patterson and Suzu Cappini. You are also the granddaughter of Harold Anderson,
  the CEO and founder of Anderson Toys, a toy company sworn to give children
  amazing products and give a large part of their profit to charity.
  .
  One day, you get called home to attend your grandfather's funeral. After the
  funeral, you learn that you have inherited his large estate. Your father
  suggests you move in immediately, so the next day, you move out of your parents
  home and into your estate.
  .
  When you enter your new home, however, you see five injured, yet very handsome
  men on the lobby floor. They eventually awaken and make it known that they were
  attacked by a group of dangerous 'misfits' and ran to find shelter, passing out
  as soon as they entered your home.
  .
  You find out that they are incubi, 'demons who consume and use sexual energy of
  humans to survive'. With nowhere to go and a target on their backs, they ponder
  what what to do. Out of sympathy, you offer your home as refuge for a while in
  exchange for minor servitude (it is a big house, after all). They happily agree.
  .
  What will happen as the incubi get comfy? Why exactly did they come the human
  world? Who are the 'misfits', and will they stop pursuing them so the incubi can
  leave?
  .
  ...Will you WANT them to leave?

developer: Terry Cavanagh
publisher: Terry Cavanagh
genre: Action
description:
  Super Hexagon is a minimal action game. The player controls a small triangle
  shape in a fixed position in the middle of the screen. The only possible
  interaction is quickly rotating the shape in a clockwise or counterclockwise
  circle with a fixed radius to avoid oncoming shapes (mostly hexagons, all
  lacking one side or more) and walls whose progression matches the music's
  rhythm. Shapes often only have a little open space the player has to steer
  towards to pass through. Shapes can rotate as well and there are some tricks
  and difficulties where speed and movement is suddenly reversed.
  .
  There is only one try: when dead, the level has to be restarted. There are
  six difficulty levels and the last three, each the "Hyper" version of the
  former three, are unlocked one by one as the corresponding standard level is
  completed. Completing a level means making the triangle avoid collisions for
  60 seconds; however, play continues indefinitely until a collision occurs.
  Optionally, the game can be played in an arcade mode: the only difference is
  a high score screen. Graphics and background music are psychedelic: sets of
  colours and tracks are specific to levels, while their order is determined
  anew at each play; a similar mechanic applies to the geometrical shapes
  running towards the centre.

description:
  Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP is presented as a vinyl disc with
  different tracks that act as episodes. It is set in the Caucasus Mountains
  and stars The Scythian, a female character that embarks on a quest. A
  side-scrolling platformer in appearance, it is much closer to an adventure
  game with nods to the likes of Zelda. It is largely focused on exploration,
  has environment puzzles that are mandatory to progress, and includes classic
  combat sequences. There is also a focus on sound and music, and it has a
  distinct retro 8-bit art style.
  .
  During her quest The Scythian meets many characters, such as Girl and
  Logfella. There is also The Archetype, an omniscient character that appears
  to narrate the story (first-person, "we") and calls her quest a session of
  trials. He appears in between episodes as an interlude and often urges the
  player to take a rest.
  .
  On mobile devices the entire game is navigated through touch-based controls.
  Moving around is done by tapping or by holding down a finger and moving along
  a path. Actions are performed by tapping twice and pinching is used to zoom.
  During fights tapping an attack or a shield icon is required. Rotating the
  device 90 degrees is needed to take out the sword, initiate fights and also
  to open the Megatome when the book has been discovered. The latter often acts
  as a hint system. During her quest The Scythian gradually learns new
  abilities that allow her to manipulate objects in the environment. It is
  possible to die during fights and progress is saved automatically. On the PC
  the touch-based input has been reworked with point-and-click mouse control.
  Tilting the device has been replaced by rotating the image on the screen with
  a key.

  Raise your shield. Embrace Lady Tallowmere's dungeons.
  .
  Indulge Lady Tallowmere. See how far through her lovingly violent dungeons you
  can delve in this 2D indie action roguelike-inspired platformer.
  .
  New rooms are procedurally generated every time you play, meaning you'll have to
  be on your guard for every randomly-placed enemy, elite, boss, and treasure
  chest you'll come across.
  .
  Each room gets progressively bigger, harder, and more rewarding the further you
  go.
  .
  The concept is simple yet hard to master:
  .
  Raise your shield to block enemy attacks.
  .
  Lower your shield and strike your foes when the timing is right.
  .
  Jump or move to avoid traps, or raise your shield to reduce damage taken.
  .
  Find the key to advance to the next room.
  .
  Collect weapons, outfits, headgear, and shields of various rarities to aid your
  journey.
  .
  Turn in souls from slain enemies to increase your base stats and passive
  abilities.
  .
  Stay alive as long as you can.
  .
  Brace yourself with your shield as you learn the quirks of each foe and trap so
  you can strive for that "one more run" high-score victory! Each dungeon is
  infinite in length so it's up to you to push your limits; a local scoreboard
  lets you track your greatest efforts.
  .
  Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Play with keyboard (and
  optionally mouse), or use your favourite gamepad/controller.
  .
  Tallowmere offers single-player and local co-op madness (up to 4 players,
  desktop-only) for fun frantic couch gaming.

developer: Crystal Game Works

genre: Visual Novel;Interactive Fiction
description:
  Idris is a bonds man- a special bonds man. While most of his clients need to
  bail loved ones out of jail, a few are looking for a reprieve from someone they
  once knew. For Evalise, all she wanted was to get a bail bond for her boyfriend,
  when Idris surprised her with a simple but confusing question.
  .
  What if you could make him forget all about you?
  .
  Evalise's boyfriend has a bit of a wild side... and a bit of a knack for being
  caught. She arrives at a bail bonds place run by a man named Idris- however,
  while working out a bail bond, he springs a question about a different kind of
  bond- a memory bond. With his knife, he's able to sever any ties a person has
  with someone else, permanently, making the other person completely forget about
  his client. With one small cut, she'd be able to leave her not-so-great
  boyfriend behind and move on...
  .
  That Which Binds Us (TWBU) is a josei otome visual novel centered around a young
  woman named Evalise. The full game is over 5 hours long and contains a new game+
  featuring an alternate story line as well as choices later on that affect
  dialogue. This game was originally made on RPG Maker MV for the Indie Game Maker
  Contest game jam in September 2017, but has since been ported to Ren'Py and has
  been heavily extended.

game: Time Surfer (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Google Android/Time Surfer (USA)/Time Surfer (USA).json
developer: Kumobius Pty. Ltd.
publisher: Kumobius Pty. Ltd.
genre: Action
description:
  Time Surfer is an endless, 2D side-scrolling game similar to Tiny Wings or
  Wavespark, but set in space. A character on a surfboard needs to survive as
  long as possible, using hills to gain speed and be launched into the air to
  travel great distances. The character moves forward automatically, following
  the curves of hills. By tapping and holding the bottom right side of the
  screen, it is possible to speed up while going downhill and then use an
  upwards slope for a launch. For maximum effect, the player needs to release
  as soon as the terrain goes up again, or all speed is lost. When performed
  successfully, the character soars near the top of the screen and is also able
  to grind planets. When the screen is tapped while in flight, the character
  dives down almost immediately, so multiple jumps can be performed quickly in
  succession.
  .
  There is only one life and there are many ways to die. Certain obstacles and
  enemies need to be avoided and there are sometimes gaps in the terrain. When
  the character goes too slow, a glowing threat appears on the left side of the
  screen and that way the character can be consumed by the end of the universe.
  Gems can be collected along the way to fill up a meter. This is used to
  manipulate time. When a mistake is made or the character dies, it is possible
  to rewind time for the amount available in the meter, providing an
  opportunity to correct the mistake. Different types of power-ups can be found
  along the way.
  .
  The game has many missions and objectives and progress is rewarded with
  pieces of cake. Cake can be traded in for flair, and costumes (also with
  vehicles, aliens, toons and holiday heroes) with different abilities. By
  leveling up, pets are unlocked that can be used to receive certain skills.
  While playing the scenery changes often. There are four main environments:
  Time Surfer, Holiday Hills, Hell Zone, and The Kepler Run.
