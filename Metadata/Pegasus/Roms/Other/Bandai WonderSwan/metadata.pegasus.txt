description:
  Jennifer Simpson is a child from the fictional Granite Orphanage in Romsdalen,
  Norway. She and her friends, who are also orphans (Laura, Ann and Lotte) are
  adopted in September 1995 (the same month the game was released) by a wealthy
  recluse named Mr. Barrows, who lives in a mansion known as the "Clock Tower",
  named after its predominant feature.
  .
  The game immediately begins with these characters walking towards the Barrows
  mansion and settling in the main foyer. Mary, the woman who brought the children
  to the mansion, leaves to find Mr. Barrows, but she takes an unusually long
  time. Jennifer offers to investigate, but upon leaving the room, a scream is
  heard from the main foyer. Jennifer returns to find the lights are off and the
  girls are missing. After finding either Laura or Ann killed, she finds herself
  being stalked by a murderous little boy with deformed features, wielding a huge
  pair of scissors. The boy is Bobby Barrows, A.K.A The Scissorman, who will be
  Jennifer's main stalker and tormentor for the rest of the game.
