game: Anarchy (Europe)

developer: Michael Sentinella
publisher: Rack-It [Hewson]
genre: Puzzle;Shooter
description:
  Inside an Ace Mk2 Interceptor tank, you have been assigned a hazardous 16-stage
  mission. You must travel to the overrun planet of Sentinel 4, and destroy the
  weapons caches the rebels have build up. They can't be blasted when you are
  right next to them, ensuring that a degree of planning and strategy is required.
  Viewed from above in levels with simple sideways scrolling, the objective on
  each level is to shoot each of the weapons crates, before going through the
  newly-opened exit. Guard droids must be avoided, but shooting them can leave
  them inactive for a short period of time, and they can now be shot or hit to
  push them in that direction, which can be used strategically to make more paths
  available. There is a 2-minute time limit on each level. Every 5th level has a
  nuclear weapon guarded by a seeking enemy droid, which continually follows you.

file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Commodore 64/Arc of Yesod, The (USA)/Arc of Yesod, The (USA).json
developer: Odin Computer Graphics Ltd
publisher: Thor Computer Software
genre: Platform
description:
  In Nodes of Yesod, a monolith was discovered on the moon that transferred data
  vital to earth's security to an alien planet. After an attempt to destroy the
  monolith failed, it was transported to its creators the Ariatans. Now it is up
  to Charlie to travel to the planet Ariat and prevent the Ariatans from accessing
  the data. Gameplay in Arc of Yesod is very similar to its predecessor. Seen from
  a side-scrolling perspective, Charlie has to explore many large caverns, filled
  with enemies and transporters, and find eight crystals that he hopes will help
  him destroy the monolith for good. To get rid of his enemies, he can once again
  control a device similar to the mole in Nodes of Yesod. Pressing up on the
  joystick releases a small sphere that can be moved across the screen (while
  Charlie stands still) and shoot at enemies. Once again, there are enemies that
  are immune to the sphere, including a spaceman who, when touched, takes away one
  of Charlie's crystals.

description:
  In this game inspired by the Monty Mole series you play Barnsley, a lazy, good
  for nothing badger whose addiction to gambling has got him into all sorts of
  trouble. One night in his local boozer he overhears a conversation. A gold coin
  was discovered in the nearby graveyard, a coin carved with the head of the
  fabled ruler Tutanbodger on one side. If Barnsley can find the lost treasure of
  Tutanbodger it would solve all his money problems.  A great journey awaits - as
  long as he doesn't fall asleep on the way!

developer: Simon Wellard
publisher: Hewson Consultants Ltd.
genre: Shooter
description:
  This side-view shoot 'em up involves trying to retrieve two nuclear weapons
  which have been stolen by terrorists. These are located at opposite ends of the
  playing area, so you can pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the
  terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far.
  .
  Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either
  from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to
  use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various
  bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all
  this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.

publisher: Epyx, Inc.
genre: Music;Strategy
description:
  Breakdance is game based on the dance craze from the early 80s and consists of
  three different games, a chance to compete in the three games together or just
  choreograph your own dance routine. One or two players can play with each player
  taking it turns to dance. The games you can play are:\n
  Hot Feet Dance Contest: This is a Simon-like simple break dancing memory game. A
  computer character performs a pattern of five break dancing moves which the
  player then has to reproduce by moving his joystick in one of four directions.
  Every round, one more move is added, increasing the difficulty the player
  continues.\n
  Battle the Rocket Crew: You are near a river and rows of dancers slowly dance
  down the screen and to make a dancer disappear you have to copy their moves. You
  need to keep making the dancers disappear or they will keep pushing you towards
  the river and it is game over when you fall into the water.\n
  Perfections Dance Puzzle: You watch a dancer perform four moves before the four
  moves appear above you in the wrong order. You have to put the moves shown, in
  the right order to win ghettoblasters.\n
  You have the option called Grand Loop and this allows you to play all three
  games to try to enter the Breakdance Hall of Fame. The choreograph option allows
  you to perform in front of a crowd and choose from 14 moves to keep them
  entertained.

description:
  The star of Thing on a Spring returns in this sequel. The evil Toy Goblin is up
  to his old tricks, with his giant toy factory producing thousands of evil toys.
  In order to shut down the factory, Thing must travel through the factory's 11
  different levels and collect the tape, floppy disk, listing paper and ROM chip
  scattered throughout.
  .
  The levels are filled with slopes, conveyor belts, interconnected pipework
  (years before Sonic the Hedgehog), and lots of foes to avoid. Question mark
  times have variable effects: stepping onto them reveals bonus points, objects,
  or a large weight that squashes Thing flat.
  .
  As Thing takes damage from enemies or weights, his oil level is reduced. When
  Thing runs out of oil, he becomes rusted and the game ends. To move between
  levels, Thing must enter the pipework through a vent and bounce around the pipes
  to find an exit.

developer: Paul Shirley
publisher: Incentive Software Ltd
genre: Action
description:
  This is a puzzle game in which players must explode all of the bombs on each
  level using a spark. The spark flows along a fuse, which is made up of a series
  of tiles. These tiles can be moved in the manner of a sliding puzzle. In other
  words, there is only one unoccupied space and adjacent tiles can be moved into
  that space, freeing a new space in the process. The aim is then to move the
  tiles so that the fuse forms a path from the spark to each bomb. There is a time
  limit, however, and extra time is knocked off if the spark reaches a dead end.
  Some levels also contain water droplets that extinguish the spark if they touch
  it.

  .
  A timer ticks down constantly, and only stops when the player reaches the grey
  tiles that mark the end of a level. Remaining time is carried over to the next
  level, and a bonus score awarded based on the number of seconds left. (The timer
  is reset after each dragon level).
  .
  There are 24 levels in total. At the end of the game a rating is awarded, from
  Hilarious to Superblazer for completing the game.

  There are three asteroids, hidden among thousands, where various minerals and
  precious gems were stored. It was believed the riches would be safe there, until
  the Zoggians discovered them! Now you have to fly an experimental spacefighter,
  the Cybernoid, into battle to recover the asteroids. The Cybernoid is equipped
  with standard laser blasters, missiles, and the ability to pick up other weapons
  along the way. Cybernoid is an arcade style action game for one player. You can
  choose from three different skill levels; easy, hard and lethal. On some
  versions two different sound modes are also available, a basic music and sound
  effects mode, and a super sound effects mode with no music. Each room you
  explore is equipped with a time bomb. The bomb will explode taking you with it
  should you take too long to get past all the obstacles on the screen. You start
  the game with nine ships, and more can be earned by collecting enough points
  during the game.

  The follow-up to Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is again a flip-screen shoot
  'em up. In control of the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the
  cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate ships. Using the range of weapon
  systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming guns,
  bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the
  screen before finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few
  seconds after you drop them. Shot pirate ships release cargo, and you must
  collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it is more prudent to
  make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all
  aliens on each screen act in the same way.

  There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's

  set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.

  Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by
  running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels,

developer: Mike Berry
publisher: Mikro-Gen
genre: Adventure;Platform
description:
  Everyone's a Wally was the first arcade adventure game to feature multiple
  playable characters - a revolutionary feature at the time. Players began in
  control of Wally (a builder and handyman), but could switch to Wilma (his wife),
  and their friends Tom (a punk mechanic), Dick (a plumber) and Harry (a hippie
  electrician) - these last three names drawn from the placeholder phrase Tom,
  Dick and Harry. Herbert (their baby son) also appeared in the game as a mobile
  hazard NPC. The player cannot freely change character; the player begins in
  control of Wally and in order to switch must be on the same screen as the
  desired character. Those not being controlled by the player wander randomly
  around the map controlled by extremely simple AI - another feature that at the
  time had never been seen before. Lives and health (called "endurance") were
  tracked independently for each character, but the game ended if any character
  died.
  .
  The aim of the game is to complete a day's worth of work for each character;
  each character has a job to do stereotypical of their skill - for instance,
  Wally has to build a wall, Wilma has to take back three books to the library,
  etc. Completing the job awards the character with a letter, which spells out a
  password to open a safe holding everyone's wages. The eventual password is
  "BREAK" - knowing this does not spoil the game since most of the letters can be
  seen before jobs are complete; the game requires them to be actually collected
  before allowing the safe to open.

  large part of the game, a unique aspect for a game of this type at the time.
  While many objects are lying around, many more must be obtained by entering the
  homes of people, and negotiating with them to arrange a swap. You can also

  (losing a life in the process).

description:
  Turmoil rocks the land and the only salvation lies in the magic of the Temple of
  Apshai. Unfortunately the location of this temple has gotten lost in time.
  Furthermore, many heros dispatched to seek it have been slain. A legend speaks
  that only the blood of the greatest hero of Apshai's greatest hero will be able
  to reclaim the lost Temple of Apshai. Unfortunately this "greatest hero" has
  also perished. But all hope is not lost, for the wise man, Merlis has found the
  hero's son, whose blood is still able to fulfill the prophesy. With great haste,
  Merlis brings the youngster to the dungeon pits and leaves him to fend for
  himself. It is this youngster's destiny to find safe passage through the 8
  levels, each of which contains passage to 99 different areas. Gateway to Apshai
  is a top-down action-RPG. As the descendant of a hero, the player starts with
  basic stats in 4 areas, Strength, Agility, Luck and Health. and basic equipment,
  a dagger and leather armor. Then it's time to choose a number between 1 and 99
  to generate the dungeon. Once begun, the player must explore the dungeon, hidden
  until explored and revealed. The player can move in four directions and has
  standard abilities, each mapped to a different control. There are several
  different actions available to the player. These include: fighting with the
  equipped weapon, a LOCATE spell to discover traps in the room, a SEARCH spell to
  discover hidden doors inside of room which would otherwise look like ordinary
  walls. Players may also use many of the items and scrolls that can be picked up
  in the dungeon. The treasure can be picked up which include weaponry (swords,
  bows and arrows), healing slaves, precious items and magical scrolls. Most items
  are only good for a single use. The Gateway to Apshai is guarded by an
  assortment of creatures including snakes, swamp rats, bats and many more. These
  enemies are only visible when they are in the same room as the player and are
  otherwise hidden. After 6 minutes and 30 seconds has passed, the player is
  teleported to the next dungeon, many versions of the game also offer the option
  to manually leave the dungeon at any time. Dungeons get progressively more
  difficult with faster and more vicious enemies.

developer: Graftgold Ltd.
publisher: Rack-It
genre: Action;Platform
description:
  Blabgorians possess the gift of psychic ability which allow them to levitate and
  move items with their minds, as a result they evolved without hands (who needs
  them?), a single foot (good for bouncing) and an oversized head (handy for
  containing large quantities of psychic energy). Gribbly Grobbly is your typical
  Blabgorian, and is tasked with the safety of the 'gribblets'. 'Gribblets' are
  infant Blabgorians; they have an armoured shell to protect them, but when
  flipped on their backs they expose their vulnerable belly and are unable to
  right themselves. They also have an annoying tendency to leave the safety of
  home in search of adventure. Unfortunately Blabgor is not a safe place; there
  are hordes of beasts roaming the landscape, eagerly searching for vulnerable
  Gribblets.
  .
  The basic premise for the game required the player to control Gribbly and
  navigate him through each of the 16 surreal 8-way scrolling landscapes in an
  attempt to locate and rescue eight baby Gribblets and returning them to the
  safety of the home cave. Gribbly can hop and levitate around each of the levels
  and can blow bubbles to defend himself. Once a Gribblet is located, Gribbly can
  pick up the hapless offspring and carry it to safety. Once only a single
  Gribblet remains on a level, the energy web fails, freeing Seon. This usually
  results in a mad rush to get the remaining Gribblet to safety before succumbing
  to his attacks. Once all the Gribblets are either saved or killed, the level
  ends and Gribbly is transported to the next level.

description:
  Heartland's meta-referential plot involves a struggle between good and evil, as
  depicted in a book, the last six pages of which have become lost. As a result,
  you must dive into the game's world to complete the story, and ensure that evil
  doesn't win, by saving the white pages and destroying the black ones. There are
  six levels, all with distinctly cutesy themes and colourful graphics. The level
  layouts are extremely complicated, and you have to make your way back to base
  after each one, before being transported onto the next one, all within a time
  limit. The levels are full of wizards who must be shot, as well as a small
  amount of character interaction.

description:
  The Alliance of Space Pilots has stolen a dangerous weapon called Z-Ray. A rebel
  sector of the Alliance sends a "Herobot" into their base to retrieve the weapon

  six parts of the Z-Ray and download the data from the main computer. There are
  12 different enemy droids that attack in different ways, some follow a set path,
  some charge the Herobot and a few can shoot. The Herobot can shoot at his
  enemies or use an energy bomb that destroys everything onscreen, but also
  depletes half of its energy. The base is laid out like a maze with energy
  barriers and conveyor belts blocking the robot's progress. Energy barriers can
  be turned off via switches, while conveyor belts can only be stopped temporarily
  by accessing terminals. Terminals can also be used to display a small map of the

  gone before - unless they happened to live there. Latest research from the

  Microgames for the Commodore CBM/PET 40 columns machines. Both versions are
  developed by Donkeysoft UK (Shaun Bebbington).
  .
  PET Snake 64 is ready to install on TheC64 Mini, but will work on all
  Commodore 64 compatible computers and emulators.
  .
  Supports keyboard and joystick in this simple and fun 'gobble and grow'
  game. Each food pellet counts down from nine to zero, and your 'Snake'
  will grow the equivalent units and thus increase your score. The
  longer you grow, the harder the game.

developer: Graftgold
publisher: Thunder Mountain
genre: Puzzle;Shooter
description:
  The game is set on a spaceship viewed from a top-down perspective. The ship
  consists of numerous rooms and levels, each one populated by hostile robots or
  "droids". The player, in control of a special droid called the "Influence
  Device", must destroy all the other droids on the ship. Each droid (including
  the player) is represented as a circle around a three-digit number. The numbers
  roughly correspond to the droid's "power" or "level", in that higher-numbered
  droids are tougher to destroy.
  .
  The Influence Device is numbered "001". The primary way in which the Influence
  Device destroys other droids is by "linking" with them, effectively taking them
  over. When the player takes over another droid, the previously-controlled droid
  is destroyed.

developer: Epyx
publisher: Epyx
genre: Racing
description:
  Race Formula-1 in several tracks while trying to beat a computer, or human
  opponent. Pay attention to your fuel and tires: It will be necessary to drive
  into a pitstop to swap them out and refuel. Tire damage is indicated by their
  colour; they start off black and become lighter as they take damage. Once they
  have turned white a collision will send the car off the track.
  .
  Six different tracks are available to race on including Brands Hatch and
  Vallelunga. Tracks can be played singly, or all together in a Grand Prix
  contest. When playing the Grand Prix this is scored in the same way as the real
  contest. Players can select how many laps they want to race and 3 different
  skill levels.
  .
  This is the first 3D racing game to implement a split-screen simultaneous
  two-player game mode. Players could be in completely different places on the
  racing track, and each split screen would show the view of the track according
  to the player's position.

game: Ranarama (Europe)

developer: Graftgold
publisher: Players Software
genre: Shooter
description:
  The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade
  gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately,
  nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a
  spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him
  attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and
  Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.
  .
  Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the
  dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least
  50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the
  Switchblade games.
  .
  The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade
  the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect).
  When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are
  in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the
  full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for
  collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.
  .
  This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and
  Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The
  Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible
  to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through
  space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means
  it’s Game Over.

  As the outlaw Robin of Sherwood, you aim to win recover the prize of the Silver
  Arrow from the Sheriff of Nottingham. Before you can enter the contest to
  recover the arrow, you must purchase your equipment from a tree spirit (Ent)
  hiding in the forest. And to purchase your equipment, you wander the forest in
  search of moneybags or rich nobles who you can ask for a "donation."
  .
  There are allies, such as the Hermit, who will heal your wounds providing you
  don't attack him. There are also foes such as Norman soldiers, the Sheriff of
  Nottingham, witches and wild boars who will impede your progress to enter the
  contest.
  .
  In a nutshell, wander the forest gathering money to buy your sword, bow and
  arrows while avoiding/defeating your enemies. You can also collect flowers to
  placate the witch who will send you to some other part of the forest instead of
  taking your money and locking you in the dungeon.

  Robin of the Wood is a maze game published in 1985 for several 8-bit computer

description:
  The game features the player as a schoolboy named Eric, with the objective of
  stealing his report card out of the staff room safe by accomplishing various
  tasks around the school. The computer controls all the other characters in the
  game, including the headmaster, other teachers and other pupils.
  .
  The four teachers are Mr Wacker (the headmaster), Mr Rockitt (the science
  teacher), Mr Withit (the geography teacher) and Mr Creak (the history master).
  Other than Eric, three of the pupils are named: Boy Wander (the tearaway),
  Angelface (the bully) and Einstein (the swot). The player has the option of
  renaming the characters before the game begins. There are also many unnamed,
  undistinguished pupils at the school.
  .
  If Eric is caught out of class or otherwise misbehaving, teacher characters
  pursue him and issue lines. When 10,000 lines or more are accumulated, the game
  ends with Eric's expulsion. However, Eric can also receive lines for things that
  are not his fault, such as lying or sitting on the floor when in fact he has
  been knocked down, or being nearest a teacher who has just been hit by a
  projectile fired by one of the other pupils. So part of the challenge of the
  game is to prevent other pupils from getting Eric into trouble.

  You play the role of Humphrey who just spends his days eating and not doing a

  castle and give him the task of retrieving the Princesses gems stolen by aliens.
  Humphrey has no choice but to attempt this task or be beheaded by the King.
  Snare is a single screen game where you must move Humphrey around the screen
  collecting all the gems on each screen over 30 levels. Each gem must be
  collected before a timer runs out and an Earthquake destroys everything.
  .
  On each screen as well as the gems, there are aliens and obstacles that need
  avoiding, and items that can help you. Aliens appear from a generator, blobs
  stick you to one spot, and there are skull and crossbones that when pushed turn
  into bombs and you have a few seconds to get out of its blast range. The
  explosion will kill any nearby aliens and remove solid walls. Teleport's can be
  used to make you appear elsewhere on the screen, rocks can hide gems, switches
  need to be used, and clocks can be collected to give yourself more time.
  .
  If you touch an alien, stand too close to a bomb or run out of time then you
  lose one of five lives.

developer: Triffix
publisher: U.S. Gold
genre: Action;Platform
description:
  You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their
  presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be
  ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow
  them up.
  .
  You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of
  the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your
  journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving
  ledges at the right moment.
  .
  The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As
  the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was
  fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a
  pseudo-3D effect.
  .
  Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7
  submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus
  points can be obtained.

game: Trailblazer (USA, Europe)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Commodore 64/Trailblazer (USA, Europe)/Trailblazer (USA, Europe).json
developer: Mr Chip Software
publisher: Mindscape
genre: Action
description:
  An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a
  succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to
  avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both
  within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots
  of holes. You can jump and thus avoid these holes, although you have a limited
  number of them for each level, and it's possible to adjust the speed through
  joystick or keyboard control. You also face a time limit on each of the levels,
  although your time is boosted every time you complete one.\n
  Released as part of Commodore Zone Issue #15 / released in the US by Mindscape /

game: Uridium (USA, Europe)

developer: Andrew Braybrook
publisher: Mindscape
genre: Shooter
description:
  The solar system is under attack! Enemy Super-Dreadnoughts have been placed in
  orbit around each of the fifteen planets in this galactic sector. They are
  draining mineral resources from the planetary cores for use in their
  interstellar power units. Each Super-Dreadnought seeks out a different metal for
  its metal converter.\n
  Your Manta class Space Fighter will be transported to each planet in turn and it
  is your task to destroy each Dreadnought. First you must attack the defensive
  screen of enemy fighters, then you must neutralise the majority of surface
  defences before you land on the Super-Dreadnought's master runway. Once on board
  you must pull as many fuel rods as possible from the metal converters before you
  take off for a final strafing run as the Dreadnought vaporises into the ether.

  Playing Instructions
  .
  On the menu screen, use joystick left and right to select a game mode.
  Joystick up and down changes between in-game music and sound effects.
  Press fire to start the game.
  .
  The object of the game is to make lines of three or more matching
  vegetables. To do so, you can swap the position of any two vegetables on the
  play screen by holding down fire and pushing in a direction. When there are
  no valid moves left then the board is shuffled – until you run out of
  shuffles, then it’s game over!
  .
  Match three vegetables and they are removed from the board, with new shapes
  dropping down to replace them. Occasionally an immovable block will be
  dropped. These can only be removed by strategically dropping them until a
  line of three or more immovable blocks is made. Match four shapes in a row
  to destroy a full row or line and match five to destroy all matching shapes
  and get an extra shuffle.

game: West Bank (USA, Europe)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Commodore 64/West Bank (USA, Europe)/West Bank (USA, Europe).json
developer: Dinamic Software
publisher: Gremlin Graphics Software
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  The game takes place at the time of the gold rush in the Wild West. You guard
  the money storage of the West Bank, into which a great number of customers put
  their money. The West Bank has 12 doors, and each of them needs to get one
  incoming payment per day. To aggravate this bandits try to rob the money from
  the bank. In the first days they are easy to defeat. Just draw the gun early
  enough. In the following days also gunslingers appear next to further bandits.
  Here, you are only allowed to shoot when the enemy draws his pistol. Some of the
  opponents simpy just put in money. The small man with the many hats brings money
  or a bomb to the bank. So pay attention well, because you will also lose one of
  your three lives if you shoot innocent people. Between each new day there is a
  duel against three bandits. Here you are only allowed to shoot when the
  corresponding opponent draws. The faster the better. Beware, you can also get
  shot or lose a life here, if you shoot too early.

game: Who Dares Wins II (Europe)

developer: Steve Evans
publisher: Alligata Software Ltd.
genre: Action
description:
  Eight invaded townships must be brought back under your control in this
  Commando-style shoot 'em up, which progresses vertically using a flick-screen
  system. You are armed with a rifle (activated by a short tap of the fire button)
  and five grenades (used via a longer press), and must not only kill off the
  enemy forces, but also rescue your comrades who have been tied to trees along
  the way. If you take too long then the prisoners will be executed by a firing
  squad. You begin at the bottom of the first screen and slowly make your way
  upwards; enemies pop up from all sides, walking around and shooting, and you
  have to dodge their shots while trying to shoot them yourself. The foes make
  good use of the decoy opportunities of the terrain, and you must do the same to
  have a chance. The levels include rivers with narrow bridges, potholes, and
  train-lines. Extra supplies are dropped in as you progress through the game, as
  are extra lives in addition to your starting 5.

  In Zynaps you play a spacecraft scrolling across a landscape jammed with alien

  spacecraft, which resembles something you'd find in a cornflakes box, but packs
  a pretty mean punch as you make your way through the waves of oncoming aliens.
