  eerie lights and the terrible sing-song rhymes of the children...

  And suddenly, you are in the house. You move from room to haunted room, step by
  terrifying step, as scenes from that night of horror come to life. Because
  Stauf's game isn't over. There were six guests the world knew about - and there
  was one other. Stauf's mad mansion lives again. And only you can end the

publisher: DeNA/Mobage
genre: Shooter
description:
  The Drowning is a first person action game which takes you to a post-
  apocalyptic world where strange creatures mercilessly attack, forcing
  you to retaliate with your weapons.
  .
  In The Drowning, your survival depends on constant movement, shooting
  creatures that attack from all angles.
  .
  Between levels, you learn the story behind this apocalyptic world and
  the ecological disaster that created the creatures you are battling,
  giving you clues on how to kill them and return to the world that you
  know.
  .
  Each level has various sub-levels, some for defense, and others for
  survival. In the defense sub-levels, creatures roam freely; in the
  survival ones, you'll confront them from behind your barricade (a fence)
  that will eventually fall to your attackers. The creatures that attack
  can come alone or in groups, throwing objects at you or even bite you.
  The unpredictability of these creatures is definitely a strong point
  of the game.
  .
  As you earn points and make it through the sub-levels, you'll need to
  find transport to advance to the next level.
  .
  The game features extremely impressive graphics and has the dignified
  atmosphere of the post-apocalyptic genre of cinema. The Drowning sucks
  you into an action-packed adventure for survival!

  Try to crash your bike in this goofy arcade game
  .
  You control a stuntman named Johnny whose goal is to collect as many gold coins
  as possible. He does this by riding his bike onto ramps, through pipes, over
  boats, and a variety of vehicles. In order to progress to higher levels you must
  collect a certain amount of gold coins. Overall, the tone of Fail Hard is light-
  hearted and displays cheesy jokes on loading screens.
  .
  Much of Fail Hard comes down to trial and error: you'll crash a few times just
  to figure out where are all the coins are located and how to reach them. This
  isn't particularly annoying and it's nice that Fail Hard doesn't force you to
  make in-app purchases to play for long periods of time.

  Framed is an award winning narrative-puzzle game that plays like an animated
  comic book. Each page of the noir thriller presents a series of panels that
  depict an important action or event. Players change the order of these events,
  changing the outcome of the story. This results in a unique interactive
  narrative, where every action is framed by the last, and the only thing tying
  the narrative vignettes together is the context the player carries in their
  mind.

description:
  Jetpack Joyride is a 2011 side-scrolling endless runner/action video game
  created by Halfbrick Studios. Originally released for iOS devices on the App
  Store on September 1, 2011, the game has since been ported to many other
  systems.
  .
  The game features the same protagonist as Monster Dash, Barry Steakfries, who
  the player controls as he steals a jet pack from a top-secret laboratory. The
  game has been met with very favorable reviews, and has won numerous awards.
  .
  .
  The game uses a simple, one-touch system to control the jetpack; when the player
  presses anywhere on the touchscreen, the jetpack fires and Barry rises. When the
  player lets go, the jetpack turns off, and Barry falls. Because he is
  continually in motion, the player does not control his speed, simply his
  movement along the vertical axis.

genre: Action;Arcade
description:
  You have always dreamed of flying - but your wings are tiny. Luckily the
  world is full of beautiful hills. Use the hills as jumps - slide down, flap
  your wings and fly! At least for a moment - until this annoying gravity
  brings you back down to earth. But the next hill is waiting for you already.
  Watch out for the night and fly as fast as you can. Otherwise flying will
  only be a dream once again.
  .

game: Vigil RPG (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Apple iOS/Vigil RPG (USA)/Vigil RPG (USA).json
developer: Jonathan Schneider
publisher: Jonathan Schneider
genre: Action;General
description:
  Vigil RPG is an 8-bit-style premium RPG where *every* battle — not just boss
  fights — is quick, yet involves interesting decision-making. Take on the role
  of a solo hero on a quest to discover the hidden cause behind the sudden
  appearance of marauding bands of goblins and monsters!
  .
  Vigil RPG strives to be the ideal pocket-size turn-based RPG, by
  incorporating these features that you may come to wish that every mobile
  game had:
  .
  * Created by a one-person development team with a design goal of maximum
  FUN — not maximum monetization! Vigil RPG has no IAPs, ads, stamina timers,
  or even "leave a review!" nags. If a feature doesn't add fun, then it didn't
  make the cut.
  .
  * Meaningful decision-making in every combat — even vs. non-boss enemies!
  Every enemy has unique attack patterns and "tells" for a clever player to
  overcome. Healing is hard to come by outside of town, so employing efficient
  battle strategy is important and rewarding.
  .
  * Fast turn-based combat! Select an action and launch each combat round in a
  single tap — no multi-level menus to navigate through. Each round takes about
  one second to play out. Zip through battles quickly against easy enemies;
  take your time to consider your strategy vs. tougher foes!
  .
  * No annoying tropes common to console-port RPGs: No imprecise on-screen
  D-pad; just tap your destination to move. No save points, or manual saving;
  your progress is continually auto-saved, even mid-battle!
  .
  * Absolutely no Internet connection required! Play start to credits in
  Airplane Mode!
  .
  * Unlike many other mobile game apps, doesn't unduly drain your phone's
  battery! Vigil RPG is an iOS exclusive, 100% implemented in Apple's native
  Objective-C language — no bulky 3rd-party frameworks!

game: Where's My Water (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Apple iOS/Where's My Water (USA)/Where's My Water (USA).json
developer: Creature Feep
publisher: Disney Mobile
genre: Puzzle
description:
  Where's My Water? is yet another iOS physics puzzler from Disney and JellyCar
  developer Walaber. The basic premise follows the vintage Disney formula: Swampy
  the alligator lives in the sewer, and it's up to the player to fill his bathtub
  with enough water to get him clean. The water supply in each stage follows
  realistic physics, so players will need to bomb it, syphon it, redirect it, or
  do anything else in their power to get it from the start of each stage into
  Swampy's tub. Players primarily accomplish this by digging paths through the
  dirt via simple touch-screen swipes.
