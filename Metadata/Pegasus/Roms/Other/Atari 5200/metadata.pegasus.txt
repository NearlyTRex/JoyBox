game: Asteroids (USA) (Proto)

developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Shooter
description:
  Trapped in space somewhere between the planets Ortanus and Earth, your ship is
  suddenly surrounded by a field of massive asteroids. And, as if that weren't
  enough excitement for one day, a group of alien saucers stage a surprise attack.
  Quickly you take over the controls to save your ship from imminent doom. You
  must thrust away from the path of the oncoming asteroids. Put up shields to
  protect the ship. Hyperspace into thin air. Flip over and get the asteroids
  attacking from behind. It's all in your hands now. Good luck!
  .
  Thought to have been planned to be a launch title for the Atari 5200 system due
  to the catalog number of CX5201. However it was never officially released but
  the prototype was found eventually. It's very similar to the Atari 8-Bit version
  of the game but unfortunately the controls are pretty poor with the 5200
  joystick. There was an official controller that was planned to be released along
  with the game but sadly this was not to be.
  .
  This is a homebrew port of the 8-bit computer series and was never officially
  released on the Atari 5200 platform.

description:
  The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen and fires
  laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a
  field of mushrooms. Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom;
  shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that
  point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with
  the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is
  destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.

description:
  We've just received word that terrorists have seized one of our missile silo
  complexes and are threatening to blow up Washington, D.C. These lunatics aren't
  fooling!
  .
  They've wired the missiles to a silo computer and started the launch sequence
  timer. In just 10 minutes the missiles will lift off for Washington... unless
  YOU stop them. Destroy all the silos in the complex with your long-range turret
  gun before the timer runs out. If you complete this mission, you'll win the
  Congressional Medal of Honor... along with 10,000 bonus points and a bonus life.
  .
  If the timer runs out before you destroy all the silos, you still have a chance
  to prevent disaster. In the seconds before impact, dock your supertank at a
  silo, enter the War Room, and guess the fail-safe code that disarms the
  missiles: The code is some combination of the letters L, E, and O... for
  example, ELL, OOO, or OLE. Succeed and you win 10,000 bonus points and a bonus
  life. Fail and... well, you'll find out.

game: Final Legacy (USA) (Proto)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Atari 5200/Final Legacy (USA) (Proto)/Final Legacy (USA) (Proto).json
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Strategy;Vehicle Simulation
description:
  This is a battle on three fronts. You are the captain of the ship Legacy. Your
  ultimate goal is to destroy the Warmongers' missile bases but you must also
  protect your cities.
  .
  You begin the game in command mode. You select your other modes with the
  joystick. Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for
  sea-to-land.
  .
  Navigation\n
  In navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note
  that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle
  represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target
  ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you
  are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes
  within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change
  to the desired mode.
  .
  Torpedo\n
  If you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode,
  you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line
  to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the
  most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not
  as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the
  weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of
  the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is
  a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.
  .
  Sea-to-land\n
  If you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To
  refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode,
  you will know you are within range if you see "Dock for refueling" on the
  screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for
  refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the
  fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base,
  position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a
  missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base,
  they will shoot missiles at a city.
  .
  Sea-to-air\n
  If a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons
  satellite. Use you joystick, or the trak-ball , if you plugged one into port 2,
  to aim at an incoming missile and press fire to blast it. If it gets past you
  but has not reached your city, you get a "Refocusing" message and the view
  switches to a short range view where you will get one more try.
  .
  Be warned that ships can attack you no matter what mode you are in. On the
  easiest level, there are no hidden bases nor do you use fuel.
  .
  The Atari 5200 version of this game was never released but is however mostly
  identical to the Atari 8-Bit version that was released.

  .
  The goal is to survive wave after wave of various insects while trying to
  destroy a Millipede that makes its way down the screen towards your player.
  While very similar to Centipede it adds quite a few new quirks such as new
  insects to contend with and DDT bombs that when shot will destroy what is around
  them.

description:
  Miner 2049er is a platform video game created by Bill Hogue that was released in
  1982 by Big Five Software. It was developed for the Atari 8-bit family and
  widely ported to other systems. The game was licensed in conjunction with
  International Computer Group.[citation needed] At the time of its release, Miner
  2049er was notable for having ten different screens, which was a large number
  for a platform game.[1][2] For comparison, the Donkey Kong arcade game had four
  screens, and many home ports didn't include all of them. The title "Miner
  2049er" evoked a 21st-century take on the California Gold Rush of around 1849,
  in which the gold miners and prospectors were nicknamed "49ers."[3]
  .
  Unlike most of the home computer versions, Miner 2049er for the Atari 8-bit
  family was released on 16K ROM cartridge with the high price, for 1982, of
  US$49.95.[4]

developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Sports
description:
  Unreleased prototype game by Steve Baker for the Atari 5200. However it was
  completed and is fully playable. Due to the Hi-Res mode used the game has some
  odd choices for colors but other than that is quite well done and simulates
  Miniature Golf very well.
  .
  Control is handled entirely by the keypad, so the non-centering 5200 joystick
  doesn't hinder the gameplay.  Pushing the # and * keys changes the direction the
  ball will be hit (represented by an arrow) and the 1-9 keys are used to indicate
  the power of the swing (1=lowest and 9=highest).

description:
  The game is played by moving a crosshair across the sky background  and launch a
  counter-missile from the appropriate battery. Counter-missiles explode upon
  reaching the crosshair, leaving a fireball that persists for several seconds and
  destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. There are three batteries, each with
  ten missiles; a missile battery becomes useless when all its missiles are fired,
  or if the battery is destroyed by enemy fire. The missiles of the central
  battery fly to their targets at much greater speed; only these missiles can
  effectively kill a smart bomb at a distance.

  BASEBALL!  It's a hot day in the ballpark--you can see the hot dog and soda\n

  other in an enormous diamond of brown and green.\n
  The roar of the spectators fades into the distance as the pitcher winds up.\n
  His arm arches back, his leg goes up, and...THUNK!  The ball flashes by and\n
  hits the catcher's glove at 90 miles an hour.  "STEERIKE!"  Another windup,\n
  another 90 mile an hour fastball, and "STEERIKE TWO!"  Gripping the bat\n
  tightly, you stare down at the pitcher, see him wind up, and watch as the ball\n
  seems to float in slow motion down the field toward you.  Everything falls\n

  ball sail over the right fielders outstretched glove and over the wall.  HOME\n

  As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all enemy
  spacecraft on the galactic chart and prevent them from destroying your
  starbases. There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the
  galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map,
  you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then
  warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed,
  you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on
  your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire,
  or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out
  of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a
  starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other
  types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your
  shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been
  destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.

  In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from
  which the player can choose:
  .
  Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above
  the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of
  play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls
  without losing either.\n
  Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are
  enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they,
  too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this,
  but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in
  play.\n
  Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle,
  the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the
  longer the ball lasts in play.

developer: Atari
publisher: AtariAge
genre: Action
description:
  Never officially released for the Atari 5200 platform. However, a more complete
  prototype version with track ball support was discovered and released by
  AtariAge.
  .
  Your goal is to destroy all the Xari's that come out of the well in the center
  of the screen before they can destroy all your blocks. You can use the joystick
  or the trackball controller.
  .
  Each player resembles a hollow paddle (like a capsule), which you can move
  around your side of the screen.  Your paddle can catch and hold up to three
  fireballs (the little star looking things that the Xari's shoot), and each
  stored fireball allows you to destroy one Xari by running into it.  If you hit a
  Xari without any fireballs stored in your paddle, it is temporarily stunned and
  you cannot catch or deflect any shots for a few seconds.  If you already have
  three fireballs stored up, your paddle will start reflecting the fireballs back
  at the Xari's (a great tactic for those hard to reach guys that won't come near
  you) and at your partner (which is not so good).  You can choose to reflect
  shots even if you don't have three fireballs stored up by pressing the bottom
  controller button.
  .
  If things start to get out of control you can activate your fire extinguisher
  (using the top controller button) to temporarily protect your blocks.  The fire
  extinguisher coats your blocks with foam and will destroy any shots that touch
  it.  the foam moves quickly down your blocks and only lasts for a few seconds so
  you have to use it wisely (like when fireballs get behind your blocks).  You get
  one new fire extinguisher each level, which can be stored for later use.
