description:
  As the name implies, A-Maze-Ing is a maze game, but with a twist: you control a
  mouse who has to make its way through an actual maze. Options include "Cheese
  Hunt" (collect 10 pieces of cheese in the right order before you are shown the
  exit), "Escape Maze" (Get to the exit as fast as you can), "Mouseholes"
  (shortcuts through the maze walls) or "Obstacles" (which blocks the center of
  the passages), whether there are cats (and how many) in the maze, how fast they
  are, and whether the cats are smart or dumb. Try to beat your own best time, or
  play with another player choosing between co-operative or competitive play.

game: Hunt The Wumpus (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Texas Instruments TI-99-4A/Hunt The Wumpus (USA)/Hunt The Wumpus (USA).json
developer: Texas Instruments Incorporated
publisher: Texas Instruments Incorporated
genre: Action;Puzzle
description:
  A mythical creature called a Wumpus is sleeping somewhere in a series of
  maze-like caves, and your goal is to hunt it down. The cave is dangerous, and in
  addition to the Wumpus there are bottomless pits and cave bats. Walking into a
  pit ends the game, encountering a bat will cause you to be relocated to a random
  location in the cave (which may or may not be safe), and walking into the same
  room as the Wumpus will cause it to wake up and eat you. To help figure out
  where these dangers are various cave rooms can provide clues. For example,
  finding blood splattered in the room means the Wumpus is near, or if you feel a
  breeze then a pit is near. From these clues you need to deduce the layout of the
  cave and the location of the Wumpus. If you think you know where the Wumpus is,
  you have one arrow to fire; a hit wins the game, but a miss means you are eaten
  by the Wumpus.

game: Moon Mine (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Texas Instruments TI-99-4A/Moon Mine (USA)/Moon Mine (USA).json
developer: John M. Phillips
publisher: Texas Instruments Incorporated
genre: Shooter
description:
  Moon Mine is a shoot' em up where the player is the captain of the U.S.S.
  Recovery and has to capture treasure that has been stolen from Earth. The
  culprit is the evil Zygonaut who has hidden the treasures in a mine shaft in the
  centre of the moon. As the player descends down the mine shaft ten different
  creatures will appear that have to be destroyed. This is done with four lasers,
  one on each side of the screen. The creatures appear far down the shaft and move
  towards the player's guns. More points are earned by shooting them at a far
  distance.
  .
  Firing the lasers too much will lead to them overheating. They are cooled with
  water and at times it is necessary to replenish the water supply. Pools of water
  occasionally appear on the screen and the player then has to send out a crew
  member to retrieve it. The crew member can destroy monsters with a hand laser
  but it only has twelve shots. At times treasure (silver, jade and amethyst) will
  appear and it is collected in the same way.

game: Parsec (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Texas Instruments TI-99-4A/Parsec (USA)/Parsec (USA).json
developer: Paul Urbanus
publisher: Texas Instruments Incorporated
genre: Shooter
description:
  Parsec is a side-scrolling space shooter. Waves of alien craft swoop down from
  the top and the player must shoot them down without colliding with them or the
  ground, running out of fuel, or overheating the ship's laser. Some enemies are
  harder to destroy and shoot back. At the end of each level, the player must
  navigate through an asteroid field which can yield many points, but can also
  result in a loss of ships in the process due to collisions.
  .
  The game takes advantage of the TI's speech synthesizer: a female voice
  occasionally makes comments such as "Nice shooting, pilot!", or "Asteroid field
  ahead" throughout the course of the game.
