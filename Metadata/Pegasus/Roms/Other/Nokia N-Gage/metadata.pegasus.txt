description:
  Tomb Raider is a 3D action game with platforming and puzzle-solving elements, in
  which players control Lara Croft from a third-person perspective. The camera
  follows Lara as she climbs, jumps, and swims through detailed environs
  overcoming environmental obstacles and deadly fauna. Moving through levels often
  involves finding spots where Lara can climb, looking for spots where Lara can
  use her acrobatic ability, and sliding blocks and pushing levers to solve
  puzzles and open passageways.
  .
  Lara is armed with twin pistols with infinite ammunition, but she can pick up
  higher caliber weapons to take on deadlier human opponents. Lara also comes
  across restorative health packs and has a compass with which she can orient
  herself. Laraâ€™s opponents include animals, gunmen, as well as primeval and
  supernatural beings. Careful explorers can also find secret areas and avoid
  traps.
