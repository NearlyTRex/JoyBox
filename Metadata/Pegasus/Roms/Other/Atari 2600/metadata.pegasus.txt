file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Atari 2600/3-D Tic-Tac-Toe (USA)/3-D Tic-Tac-Toe (USA).json
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Puzzle
description:
  The game is similar to the traditional game of tic-tac-toe, but is played on
  four 4×4 grids stacked vertically; it is basically a computerized version of the
  board game Qubic using traditional tic-tac-toe notation and layout. To win, a
  player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically,
  horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four
  grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight
  possible ways to win on a standard 3×3 board. The game has nine variations: it
  can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against
  a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the
  standard joystick controller.

  Requiring discipline and sweat, stamina and speed, with muscles opposing

  the decathlon. Earn points for each event. Highest final score wins!
  .
  Up to four players compete in the ten different events of a real-life decathlon,
  either in sequence or individually. The game became somewhat notorious for the
  amount of wear or damage inflicted upon console controllers, where rapid
  back-and-forth movement of the joystick propels the athlete down the track.

game: Adventure (USA)

developer: Warren Robinett
publisher: Atari
genre: Adventure
description:
  An evil magician has stolen the Enchanted Chalice and has hidden it somewhere in
  the Kingdom. The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place
  it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs.
  .
  This is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder
  you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgle, the Yellow Dragon,
  who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and
  ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of
  all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to
  outmaneuver.
  .
  There are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and
  the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be
  opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or
  dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).
  .
  The Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the
  Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the
  Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom
  .
  Adventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to
  contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a
  stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any
  given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the
  player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any
  commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure
  creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.

file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Atari 2600/Air-Sea Battle ~ Target Fun (Japan, USA) (En)/Air-Sea Battle ~ Target Fun (Japan, USA) (En).json
developer: Larry Kaplan
publisher: Atari, Inc.
genre: Shooter
description:
  Air-Sea Battle is basically a target shooting game. On most settings, you are
  positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of
  the screen. The various settings provide different targets and weapons with
  different characteristics.
  .
  In games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at
  aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of
  firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of
  minor control over the direction of your missile.
  .
  In games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above.
  On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the
  bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above.
  Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired.
  In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time,
  however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks,
  rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6.
  .
  In games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying
  above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When
  you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your
  ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to
  change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the
  missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.
  .
  In games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the
  ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The
  difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets
  below.
  .
  In Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.
  .
  Each of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly
  enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end
  if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.) I

  Armor Ambush (Armor Battle on the Intellivision) is a two player game, where
  each player is in command of two tanks (one at a time), and they must try to
  destroy each other. (Similar in some ways to Atari's own game, Combat.)
  .
  The battlefields constantly change, so no battle is ever the same. Tanks move at
  average speed on grass, fast on roads, slow through trees, and slowest through
  water.

developer: Bradley G. Stewart
publisher: Atari
genre: Shooter
description:
  Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and
  pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids
  are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the
  asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly
  across the screen.
  .
  The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any
  direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship
  direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed
  spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship
  or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the
  hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the
  spaceship in the process.
  .
  Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are
  three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small
  asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into
  two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed.
  .
  Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers
  to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at
  the Novice Level.
  .
  Game Difficulty and Variations\n
  There are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and
  Expert.
  .
  The game also offers three different game variations:
  .
  Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is
  destroyed.
  .
  Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time.
  Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship
  will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship
  reserves.
  .
  Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is
  disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy
  the other player's spaceship and just pass through. Ship reserves for both
  players are combined.
  .
  Scoring\n
  The score of the Player 1 is viewable on the upper left side of the screen,
  while Player 2 on the opposite upper right side. A player will be awarded a new
  reserve ship for every 10,000 points.
  .
  Small saucer - 1,000 points\n
  Other player's ship - 500 points\n
  Large saucer - 200 points\n
  Small asteroid - 100 points\n
  Medium asteroid - 50 points\n
  Large asteroid - 20 points

description:
  The objective of Asteroids is to score as many points as possible by destroying
  asteroids and flying saucers. The player controls a triangular-shaped ship that
  can rotate left and right, fire shots straight forward, and thrust forward. As
  the ship moves, momentum is not conserved - the ship eventually comes to a stop
  again when not thrusting. The player can also send their ship into hyperspace,
  causing it to disappear and reappear in a random location on the screen (with
  the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid).

developer: Hal Finney
publisher: Mattel Electronics
genre: Shooter
description:
  In Astroblast, the player controls a laser cannon at the bottom of the screen;
  the goal is to earn as many points as possible by destroying the various
  incoming meteors, bombs, and other objects. Points are earned for destroying
  objects, while points are lost for letting them get past the player. Meteors are
  the most common item needed to defend against. They come in various sizes and
  colors, and some even split into two smaller meteors when shot.
  .
  Mixed in with the meteors are white spinning bombs. While letting a meteor get
  past, the player will only lower the score; the player have to shoot the
  spinners. If one gets past, the player will lose a life. On the more difficult
  levels, UFOs and guided missiles will also appear occasionally and attempt to
  destroy the player's cannon.
  .
  If trapped in a hopeless situation, the cannon may enter hyperspace and be
  instantly transported to a different location on the screen. Just be careful,
  sometimes the player may be transported to a situation worse than the one the
  player left! The game ends when all of laser canons have been destroyed.

developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Puzzle
description:
  In this game, you control Marvin the Cube Master. You move him around a
  six-sided cube with nine squares to a side. The object is to get all nine sides
  to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on
  the game variation you select.
  .
  Marvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire
  button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot
  move onto a space of the same color as he is.
  .
  To rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the
  direction to rotate.
  .
  The game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest
  moves. Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except
  when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on. Two of the game
  variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict
  you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.
  .
  Eight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.
  .
  This game started out as Atari Video Cube but eventually was licensed under the
  Rubik's Cube name. This game is distinct from the similarly named game Rubik's
  Cube 3-D which is displayed in three dimensions so the player can see three of
  the cube faces at once rather than one.

  BASIC Programming is an Atari 2600 cartridge that teaches simple computer

  cartridges designed for the console. The programming language is similar to
  dialects of BASIC.
  .
  Up to nine lines of programming code could be entered in a basic-esque
  programming language, using both of the Atari 2600 keypad controllers. Due to a
  64 character limitation, and the Atari's own RAM size of 128 bytes, only
  extremely simple programs could be written and executed. Intended as a learning
  tool, BASIC Programming was not intended for serious programming, indeed, there
  is no way to permanently store a program once written, as the Atari lacks

  .
  Acey Deucey was a variation created by sailors in the U. S. Navy. As such, the
  rules for acey deucey will vary from ship to ship and person to person. For
  Atari, this is the variation used here:\n
  All pieces start out on the central Bar and can be entered at any time with the
  roll of the dice.\n
  No piece NEEDS to be moved from the bar first, even if it was hit and sent to
  the bar.\n
  A roll of 1-2 (acey deucey) allows a player to choose whichever doublet s/he
  wants, after making the 1-2 move.\n
  After moving the doublets, the player is awarded another dice roll.\n
  If, after moving your doublet, the other dice roll is 1-2, you can move the 1-2
  and choose another doublet.
  .
  Difficulty switches\n
  Right:\n
  A=computer rolls dice for you\n
  B=you can roll real dice and dial in the numbers\n
  Left:\n
  A=computer sets up the board for you\n
  B=you can set the pieces where you want them.

publisher: Atari
genre: Shooter
description:
  Commonly considered the earliest progenitor of first-person shooters (FPS),
  Battlezone is a 3D tank game initially released in the arcades, and later
  converted officially to many systems. Earth has been invaded, and you and your
  tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a
  first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a
  radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects
  can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank
  realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining
  forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees
  you change direction more quickly.
  .
  A standard enemy tank is worth 1,000 points when destroyed; a supertank is worth
  3,000 points; and the flying saucer is worth 5,000 points. The guided missile is
  worth 2,000 points when destroyed. Each of these targets can be destroyed with a
  single shot from the player's tank. One bonus tank (a bonus "life" or "man") is
  awarded when the player's score reaches 15,000 points; an additional tank is
  then awarded at 100,000 points.\n
  The player can hide behind the solids or maneuver in rapid turns once fired on
  to buy time with which to fire himself.

developer: David Rolfe
publisher: Activision
genre: Shooter
description:
  Beamrider is a 3D arcade action game. You control a beam riding spaceship on a
  mission to clear 99 sectors of space from hostile aliens. The spaceship is
  located at the bottom of the screen and it can only stop on one of five beams.
  You are armed with both lasers and torpedoes; torpedoes are more powerful and
  can destroy more enemies compared to lasers, however you only get three per
  level. To complete a sector, you need to destroy fifteen white flying saucers.
  After all saucers are destroyed, the sector sentinel passes by which can be
  destroyed for extra points. Each even number sector up until sector 16 will add
  a new type of enemy to deal with. These additional enemies will just try to slow
  your mission, though, only the saucers need to be destroyed to advance.
  Occasionally a rejeuvinator will appear; if this is collected, you can earn an
  extra life. But be careful, because if you accidentally shoot the rejeuvinator
  it will turn into an enemy!

description:
  Blackjack is based on the casino card game of the same name. You can play alone
  or with up to 2 other players against the computer that takes the role of the
  dealer.
  .
  The game follows the same basic rules as its casino counterpart. Each player
  starts the game with 200 chips, and each can bet from 1 to 25 chips to get a
  hand. A player breaks the bank when he reaches 1000 chips and loses when he has
  no more chips to bet. In both cases, he is removed from the game. At any time, a
  player may quit or resume the game by using the game select switch. A player who
  went broke or who reached 1000 chips may also stay on the game using the same
  switch. He will then start with 200 chips.

developer: Larry Kaplan
publisher: Atari
genre: Sports
description:
  Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a
  one-player or a two-player game.  There are ten "pins" to knock down.  You have
  two tries (or rolls) to knock down the pins each time you're up.  Each game
  consists of ten "frames" (or turns).
  .
  If you succeed in knocking down all the pins on your first roll, it's called a
  "strike".  A strike is marked with an "x" on the TV screen.
  .
  If you leave pins standing, but "pick them up" on your second try, it's called a
  "spare".  Spares are marked with a "/" on the screen.
  .
  An "open frame" occurs when you fail to knock down all then pins in two rolls.
  Open frames are indicated with a straight horizontal line (-) on the screen.
  .
  The ultimate goal in BOWLING is to roll 12 consecutive strikes for a "perfect"
  score of 300.

developer: Bob Whitehead
publisher: Activision
genre: Sports
description:
  Boxing shows a top-down view of two boxers, one white and one black. When close
  enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire
  button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly.
  Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the
  manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed
  either when one player lands 100 punches (a "knockout") or two minutes have
  elapsed (a "decision"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most
  landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible.\n
  While the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent
  on the "ropes" and "juggling" him back and forth between alternate punches.

  CANYON BOMBER GAMES
  .
  GAME 1 - Canyon Bomber (One-Player):
  .
  Test your skill against the computer.  It's not an easy task.  You've got six
  misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time
  the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks "fall" to a lower level
  (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall
  to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.
  .
  Keep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the
  screen.  It is a "miss indicator" and gradually decreases in length each time
  you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also
  color-coordinated with your planes and your score.
  .
  Set your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach
  the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be
  very difficult to obtain.
  .
  .
  GAME 2 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):
  .
  This game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another
  player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against
  both players.  the player with the highest score wins.
  .
  Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's "miss indicator" as well as your
  own.  Bombs away!
  .
  .
  GAME 3 - Canyon Bomber (One-Player):
  .
  This one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a
  lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay "suspended" in their original
  position when the surrounding bricks are hit.
  .
  .
  GAME 4 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):
  .
  You compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the
  brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.
  .
  .
  GAME 5 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):
  .
  Get set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to
  score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or
  misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.
  .
  No "miss indicator" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.
  .
  .
  GAME 6 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):
  .
  This game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.
  .
  .
  SEA BOMBER GAMES
  .
  GAME 7 - Sea Bomber (One-Player):
  .
  You're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom,
  you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady
  competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you're a winner!
  .
  .
  GAME 8 - Sea Bomber (Two-Player):
  .
  This time you're competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point
  mark.

game: Centipede (Japan, USA) (En)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Atari 2600/Centipede (Japan, USA) (En)/Centipede (Japan, USA) (En).json
developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Shooter
description:
  In Centipede, the player is trapped in the Enchanted Forest. Armed with only a
  magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are
  attacking in the player in continuous waves.
  .
  The player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to
  score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller
  button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an
  insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three
  starting magic wands.
  .
  Insect Opponents and Mushrooms\n
  All enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the
  player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are
  as the following:
  .
  The Centipede\n
  The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will
  have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will
  have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The
  third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus
  two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue
  to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached
  heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points
  than body segments.
  .
  Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving
  downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body
  segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will
  become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly
  disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.
  .
  The Spider\n
  The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It
  will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is
  hit in closer distances.
  .
  The Flea\n
  The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms.
  It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea
  will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much
  faster.
  .
  The Scorpion\n
  The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up
  speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.
  .
  Mushrooms\n
  Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the
  player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly
  destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and
  Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and
  are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body
  segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom.
  Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards
  the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially
  damaged mushroom.
  .
  .
  Game Difficulty and Variations\n
  The game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert.
  Game Variations are as the following:
  .
  One Player\n
  Two Player Alternating\n
  Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.\n
  Dual Player Competition\n
  Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate.
  Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.\n
  Team Play Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is
  combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.
  .
  .
  Scoring\n
  The player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of
  six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the
  following:
  .
  Centipede Head - 100 points\n
  Centipede Body Segment - 10 points\n

  Checkers is a computerized version of the popular board game and follows the

  The object of the game is to remove all of your opponents pieces from the 8x8

  board; an opponent's piece is removed from play if one of your pieces jumps over
  it (if any of your pieces are able to jump an opponent's piece, you must make
  that move). When beginning the game pieces can only move in a diagonal forward
  direction until they reach the other side of the board; that piece then becomes
  'kinged' allowing movement both forwards and backwards.

  Combat 2 is video game for the Atari 2600. Originally announced in 1982, it was
  subsequently cancelled. Developed by Atari, the game was supposed to be the
  sequel to the classic Atari VCS game Combat, which was bundled with the system.
  In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and
  has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation
  Atari's Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app
  Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012.
  .
  Environments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests
  that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or
  used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning
  the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used
  — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get
  as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over
  the original.
  .
  The game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was
  forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and
  sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished
  game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to
  find a level editor inside the game.
  .
  The game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the "Games That Weren't"
  section.

  Combat is an early video game by Atari for the Atari 2600. It was released as
  one of the nine launch titles for the system in October 1977, and was included
  in the box with the system from its introduction until 1982.
  .
  Combat is a two-player game where the players attempt to shoot each other's
  tanks or planes. Hitting the enemy vehicle pushes it back and gives the player
  one point. The game contains 27 levels, each of which has different rules and
  playing field layout. On the tank levels, the players have a selection of two
  different mazes or no walls at all, while on the plane levels, the players can
  choose to play with clouds that obscure part of the screen. The Atari 2600
  difficulty settings can be used to change the range of a player's missiles, as
  well as the speed of one's airplanes in levels 15-27. All games have a time
  limit of 136 seconds.
  .
  The levels include:
  .
  1-5: Tank levels. Levels 3 and 5 are "straight missile" levels where the
  players' projectiles simply fly forward. On the "guided missile" levels (1, 2,
  4) the projectiles can be controlled with a joystick after firing.\n
  6-9: "Tank-pong" levels, where the players' missiles bounce off walls. In the
  "billiard hit" levels (8 and 9), there's an additional rule that a missile must
  bounce at least once before it can hit the enemy tank.\n
  10 and 11: Invisible tank levels, where the tanks only become briefly visible
  when they shoot, bump into a wall, or are hit by a missile. Both of these give
  the players guided missiles.\n
  12-14: Invisible "tank-pong" levels. Levels 13 and 14 use the "billiard hit"
  rule.\n
  15-20: Biplane levels, where the players fly planes that are constantly moving
  forward and wrap around to the other side when they fly off the screen. Levels
  15 and 19 use guided missiles; 16 and 20 use straight missiles; on 17 and 18 the
  players use rapid-fire machine guns. Additionally level 19 is a "2 vs. 2" level
  - both players have two planes each that move and shoot together - and level 20
  is "1 vs. 3", where one player has three planes while the other has a single
  large plane.\n
  21-27: Jet fighter levels. The jet planes move faster than biplanes, but other
  than that gameplay remains similar. 22, 24 and 27 are straight missile levels,
  the rest are guided missile levels. Additionally 25 and 27 are "2 vs. 2" levels,
  while 26 is a "1 vs. 3" level.
  .
  One of the very few Atari 2600 games actually programmed to be in stereo (which
  can only be experienced with a modified system).

developer: Bob Whitehead
publisher: Atari,Inc.
genre: Strategy;Board Game
description:
  Early, unreleased version of Video Chess. Video Chess is the game that led Atari
  to first invent bank-switched ROMs for the Atari 2600, even though the shipping
  version of the game wouldn't use the technique and was only 4K in size.
  .
  This is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in
  this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved
  then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go
  and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning
  sound and not make the move.
  .
  To castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your
  king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then
  automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot
  castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares
  between the king and rook are threatened.
  .
  Another maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy
  pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant,
  you must advance your pawn to the fifth rank. Your opponent then has the option
  of moving his or her pawn one square (where it would be under attack) or two
  squares. If you opponent elects to move two squares, the en passant move allows
  you to take that pawn by diagonally moving your pawn to the square that was
  skipped over.
  .
  Skill levels\n
  These determine how long the computer will think on its move. These times are
  approximate and may vary slightly, depending on what move you did.\n
  Level 1=15 seconds\n
  Level 2=30 seconds\n
  Level 3=45 seconds\n
  Level 4=2 minutes, 45 seconds\n
  Level 5=3 minutes, 15 seconds\n
  Level 6=12 minutes\n
  Level 7=10 hours\n
  Level 8=10 seconds
  .
  Level 8 is a beginner level.

description:
  Listen!  An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin's
  sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a
  monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an
  ear...
  .
  You will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by
  listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:
  .
  THE SEAGULL:\n
  Periodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the
  squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then
  quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also,
  the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your
  dolphin and the squid.
  .
  THE SLIP:\n
  Another great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him "the slip".  If the
  squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse
  your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's
  good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.
  .
  SCORING:\n
  Points are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a
  seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the
  color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.
  .
  Also, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each
  time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through
  the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy
  in getting her through the opening.
  .
  At 300,000 points, the word Amazing! appears on the top of the screen and the
  game stops.

developer: Larry Miller
publisher: Activision
genre: Racing
description:
  Enduro is an action racing game similar to Pole Position. Your goal is to last
  as long as you can in an enduro race; each day of the race you are required to
  pass a certain number of cars. If you succeed, you get to continue on, fail and
  you are out of the race. The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by;
  not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts
  of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will
  occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes,
  the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the
  screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you
  made it.

publisher: Atari, Inc.
genre: Puzzle;Strategy
description:
  Flag Capture is an action/strategy game for one or two players. Your goal is to
  locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move
  your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if
  the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags
  location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may
  appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how
  many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start
  again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible
  in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games:
  in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and
  whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games,
  players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available
  which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move,
  or add an invisible wall around the playfield.

  Football is a football game for two players. The game is played from a top down
  point of view of the field and features two skill levels and three game
  variations. Using the joystick you can choose from one of five different
  offensive or defensive plays. In the first game variation, after selecting a
  play you then control the players on the field. In the second game, you have the
  option of controlling your players after a play is selected or allowing the
  computer to control the players. The third game has the computer controlling the
  players at all times and you only need to select the plays you wish it to
  execute and indicate when you wish to punt or pass the ball. In all of the game
  variations the timer begins at 5 minutes, and is active only during plays. Of
  course, the team with the most points when the timer runs out wins!
  .
  GAME 1:\n
  After programming your play, use the Joystick to control your players.  The
  offensive player controls only the ball carrier and the flight of the pass or
  punt.  The defensive player controls his lineman or, by holding the red
  controller button down, the defensive\n
  back.
  .
  The players will randomly follow the play as programmed when not controlled by
  your Joystick.
  .
  GAME 2:\n
  In this game, when your players are not controlled by the Joystick, they will
  follow the play exactly as programmed.  Use more strategy and try to outguess
  your opponent's plays.
  .
  GAME 3:\n
  Program in your offensive and defensive plays and watch the computer run them
  out.  Neither player can control the players movements, but the offense can pass
  or punt the ball by pushing the red controller button.

  chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in
  an effort to "get to the other side." Every time a chicken gets across a point
  is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either
  slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what
  difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player
  who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted.

  Trivia
  .
  Before Freeway became a game about a chicken crossing the road, it was
  originally known as Bloody Human Freeway. While the gameplay was exactly the
  same, players controlled a human instead of a chicken. If the cars hit the
  person, he would explode into a little blood splatter instead of being bounced
  backwards. Bloody Human Freeway can be found in playable form on the Game Boy
  Advance version of Activision Anthology.

  Frog Pond is a games that Atari never officially released to the public.  2
  different versions exist with this - one with a "rainbow" title screen, and one

  earlier (work-in-progress) version was shown at the Summer 1982 CES show.
  Prototypes (and possibly copies) have been available for some time now.  Best
  Electronics had it for $12 at one time.

  The game has nice, clean graphics.  The game features nice, clean graphics, with
  1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad.  Each frog even has its own realistic "ribbet"
  sound.  The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your
  frog's tongue.  Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out.  The
  difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set
  to B).  There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4
  are two-player versions.  You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away
  if you fail to get it after a certain time limit.  Games 3 and 4 allow more
  misses, but less time to get the insects.  There are five types of insects.
  .
  The game subject and total lack of difficulty shows this game was going to be
  aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to
  Diamonds. This and the fact that it looked almost identical to Mattel's Frogs
  and Flies could have been the reason it was eventually not released.

  The evil being called Gravitar is out attempting to destroy the universe! With
  each galaxy he conquers he leaves behind extreme gravitational forces, a
  powerful, explosive reactor and deadly bunkers. Your job is to stop Gravitar by
  taking back the twelve solar systems located in four galaxies that are under his
  control! In each solar system there is a sun, an alien reactor base, and three
  to four planets. To free the solar system, you have two choices; either visit
  all of the planets and destroy all enemy bunkers, or activate the reactor at the
  core of the alien base and escape before it explodes. On each of the planets and
  the alien base, there will be strong gravitational forces to deal with; make
  sure you keep your ship in space, since a crash into the ragged landscape will
  be fatal! After a galaxy has been freed, you then automatically move on to the

  There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners,
  and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way
  through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and
  find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on
  your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack
  will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the
  many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which
  can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll
  encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be
  blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of
  dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow
  yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be
  used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy.
  As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like,
  creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will
  appear which are dangerous to the touch.

description:
  Hidden throughout a haunted mansion are three pieces of a magical urn, and your
  goal is to enter the mansion and retrieve all three before you lose your nine
  lives! The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your
  eyeballs as you explore the four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your
  mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout.
  Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to
  lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a
  magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its
  inhabitants.

  The mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the
  rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The
  mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it
  (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To
  reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited
  supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be
  surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!
  .
  You are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a
  strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn,
  you will need to put down the scepter. You win the game when all three pieces of
  the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track
  of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the
  better the score.

  In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land
  in a bucket of water. To do this you need to adjust your cannon so the position,
  angle, and firing speed are just right. You score a point for each successful
  landing, and the game ends after seven attempts. Several game variations are
  included which allow you to have the position, angle and speed all set by the
  player, or have one or more of these in a fixed position, or have one or more of
  these randomly set by the computer. If you wish to make the game more
  challenging, you can also set a moving wall in front of the bucket which will
  make your timing more critical.

description:
  Ice Hockey is an ice hockey game for one player against the computer or two
  players. Each team consists of two players, one offensive and one defensive. At
  any given time one player is active and can be controlled while the other
  remains inactive; if the puck is near your goal then the defensive player
  becomes active, otherwise you control the offensive player. Each player has the
  ability to shoot the puck at a variety of angles, and can even body check their
  opponent! The game lasts for three minutes, and whoever scores more points by
  the end of that time wins. The game can be played at normal or high speed, and
  optionally one of the players can be handicapped to give an inexperienced player
  more of an advantage.

description:
  Indy 500 is a racing game played from a top down point of view. In the one
  player game, your goal is to complete as many laps as you can in 60 seconds. In
  the two player game, the first player to complete 25 laps wins! Included are
  several different race tracks, two difficulty levels, and additional game
  variations called ice race, tag, and crash 'n score. In ice race, the track is
  icy causing your car to slide often and making it difficulty to steer. In tag,
  one player is "it" and needs to tag the other player. For each second you race
  without being tagged, a point is earned. Lastly, in crash 'n score the goal is
  to crash into targets which appear on the race track. The first player to crash
  into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on
  the track.

game: Kabobber (USA) (Proto)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Atari 2600/Kabobber (USA) (Proto)/Kabobber (USA) (Proto).json
developer: Bradford, Rex
publisher: Activision
genre: Action
description:
  The basic gameplay of Kabobber is very simple; you must hop on the enemy before
  he hops on you.  To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an
  army of Buvskies.  Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares
  immediately surrounding your character.  When first summoned your Buvskies are
  only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full
  strength.  Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by
  all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength.  You
  are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the
  screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you
  are limited to nine reserve Buvskies).  Your army moves with you in a square
  formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you
  are.  However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and
  you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.
  .
  Kabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalog. No
  instruction manual was ever made for it and the game was never released. Only
  one prototype is known to exist, assumably from programmer Rex Bradford himself.
  According to Bradford: 'What happened was that I "finished" the game in the
  standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would
  like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it. I had basically
  run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted. Anyway, I didn't feel
  like working on it more, and Activision didn't want to publish it as is (and was
  probably a little miffed at my attitude, though they never said so), and that
  was that.'

  Keystone Kelly, sent in to capture Harry. Harry is trapped in a four story mall,
  and is running as fast as he can to reach the exit at the top. Your job is to
  catch up to him and send him to prison. You will need to use either the
  escalators at the end of each floor, or the elevator in the middle to go from
  floor to floor. The escalators may be further away, but the elevator moves
  pretty slowly so you will need to decide which route will be faster in getting
  you closer to your goal. If Harry can make it to the top before you catch him,
  you will have to retry that level. Harry has no intention of letting you catch
  him easily, and is hurling everything he can find in an attempt to slow you
  down. Shopping carts, bouncing balls, biplanes, and more will all be flying past
  on the screen and will either slow you down or send you back to the beginning if
  you get hit. As the levels progress, Harry will run faster and faster, and more
  objects will be tossed your way to duck and jump over.

developer: David Crane
publisher: Activision
genre: Shooter
description:
  The object of Laser Blast is to destroy a series of land-based enemies. The
  player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the
  planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an
  invisible force field that prevents the player's saucer from getting too close
  to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser
  blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must
  destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their
  own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose
  altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall,
  potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave
  of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while
  the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the
  saucer can move.\n
  Players score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave
  up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with
  each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in
  reserve.\n
  Players who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to
  Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.

description:
  This is a computer game simulation of a miniature golf course. It attempts to
  refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance. As in a
  traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your
  path to the cup. Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be
  played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.
  .
  Rather than a full 18 holes, this miniature golf variation has a nine-hole
  half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit
  the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the
  cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes.
  While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned
  to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned
  to each hole.
  .
  Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the
  strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many
  strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game
  continues on to the next hole.

  be the first to shoot his opponent ten times. Several game variations are
  included in both the one and two player versions. In the middle of the screen is
  one of several possible obstacles to make the game more difficult. A giant
  cactus, a stagecoach, a moving stagecoach, or a breakable wall all can block the
  target or provide some shelter for you to hide from your opponents shots. You
  also have the choice of unlimited fire, or only a six shooter. If you choose the
  six shooter, then each player must use up all six shots before either player can
  reload. And lastly, there is the "getaway" option. With getaway, a player may
  move immediately after firing; without getaway, a player must remain stationary
  for as long as his bullet is on the screen.

  One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a
  little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the
  various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.
  .
  Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost
  Bashful ("Inky"), the trailing red ghost Shadow ("Blinky"), the fast pink ghost
  Speedy ("Pinky"), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey ("Clyde"). One touch from
  any of these ghosts means loss of a life for Pac-Man.
  .
  Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating one of the four
  Power-Pills located around the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and
  Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of
  time as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box and regenerate to chase

description:
  One of the largest and most successful games ever created for the Atari 2600.
  Made possible by custom hardware built inside the game cartridge. Programmer
  David Crane designed and patented a component he called the Display Processor
  Chip (DPC), which could greatly enhance the 2600's graphics capabilities and
  could process music in three channels plus drums.
  .
  You control Pitfall Harry as he makes his way through an underground Peruvian
  cave in search of the valuable Raj diamond, as well as his lost niece and cat.
  Once all three have been found, the game is over. The gameplay is fundamentally
  the same as Pitfall!, but with a few new twists. The environments are no longer
  limited to a horizontal plane, so navigating through the complex maze of
  corridors becomes a matter of puzzle solving and timing. Harry has also gained
  the abilities to swim and float across chasms using a balloon. The scorpions
  make a return appearance, but there are many new creatures for Harry to avoid,
  such as frogs, bats, electric eels, and condors.

  The PAL version of this game doesn't show a second rock on the left side of the
  first screen and also lacks the sunset sky of the NTSC version.

description:
  You are the great French private eye Pierre Touche. Your job is to capture the
  criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to
  find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you
  control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the
  loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you:
  questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot
  holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From
  time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you
  jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for!
  If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can
  move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find
  the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to
  finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a
  unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to
  complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the
  gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum,
  or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a
  time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case
  before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a
  different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks
  so there will be a greater area to search! In addition to the various cases,
  several difficulty settings are included which control the speed of your car and
  how high you can jump.

  them! The screen is broken up into four sectors (one on each edge of the
  screen), with the prison in the center. Your character is equipped with three
  phaser balls; on the screen you will see the captors running up and down
  vertically, and you need to hit them with a phaser ball. When hit, the captor
  will be destroyed and one of the Runts will be able to escape. The Runts will
  run back and forth horizontally, and you need to catch them before they run into
  the deadly wall at the edge of the screen. To make the game more challenging,
  you are only equipped with three phaser balls! This means after firing a phaser
  ball, you will need to quickly run around to the other side of the screen and
  catch it before it disappears. You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the
  captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game
  is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail
  to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall,
  the critter counter will decrease. If the critter counter runs out, the game

genre: Action
description:
  Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure game which is loosely based on the movie
  of the same name. In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the
  Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison.
  Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way
  to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room
  you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the
  secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the
  Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your
  way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark
  and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves
  Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows
  you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different
  locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden)
  which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or
  gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to
  unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the
  game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your
  progress, and of course numerous snakes!
  .
  The manual mentions the appearance of a 'special signature' on the final screen
  if your score is high enough (although this isn’t entirely true). On the final
  screen showing the Ark, the initials HSW2 (for Howard Scott Warshaw – the 2
  denotes this is his second game) appear in your inventory.
  .
  A screenshot of Jerome M. Domurat's initials in the 'Valley of Poison' appeared
  in several publications. For reasons unknown, this graphic was removed in the
  released version. Also, a second key exists in the program which cannot be found
  in the game. It seems the key was originally going to appear on the 'Entrance
  Room' (see the screenshots in the b&w ad below), but due to the way the kernel
  displays objects, it couldn’t be used.
  .
  The manual also states the possibility of an extra-terrestrial Yar near the
  'Flying Saucer Mesa'. This is true and here’s how to find it: go to the 'Flying
  Saucer Mesa' with the Chai and a parachute. Walk off the bottom of the mesa and
  drop the Chai when you start falling. The Yar will appear above you at the top
  of the screen. Uncovering the Yar is required to reveal the initials.

developer: Gaucher, Joe
publisher: Atari (USA)
genre: Sports
description:
  RealSports Basketball is the only title in the RealSports series that was
  announced and never released. Atari decided to contract the programming of the
  game to Roklan who had recently done Crazy Climber for them. Although the game
  was finalized and given to Atari, they ultimately decided not to publish it.
  There's no concrete explanation as to why this was, but there may have been some
  concerns about the gameplay not being as polished as it should be. Earlier
  versions of the game had a referee who would run up and down the side of the
  court calling fouls (his graphics are still in the game code, just like at least
  one player animation and an Atari logo that isn't used), but was taken out due
  to lack of space. The referee can be seen in early promotional shots of the
  game, so the decision to remove him must have been made quite late. While
  RealSports Basketball is an improvement over the Atari's classic Basketball
  game, it was too little too late. Obviously Atari had some doubts about this
  title, but it remained on Atari's schedule until late fall of 1983 meaning that
  they may have been reconsidering releasing it. In the end they decide not to.
  .
  Although technically speaking this is still a PAL game, the final version was
  meant to be released as a NTSC game.

  the goal is to march down a 100-yard field using a combination of passing and
  running plays. There are three ways to score: crossing the defensive team's goal
  line is a touchdown worth seven points, kicking the ball through the defense's
  goal post is a field goal worth three points, and tackling the ball carrier
  inside the end zone is a safety worth two points.

  RealSports Volleyball for the Atari VCS does a nice job simulating two-on-two
  beach volleyball, complete with ocean view, a setting sun, and a roaming shark.
  The computer players are challenging, and trying to line up a player under the
  ball's shadow can be tricky. However, two drawbacks somewhat diminish gameplay:
  both players must be controlled simultaneously, meaning sometimes neither player
  can quite reach the ball; and players can't jump to block a spike.

  There are numerous enemy tanks crossing the countryside, destroying everything

  first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of
  tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete
  squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more
  difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will
  alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to
  the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly.
  Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your
  targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when
  visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites,
  such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it
  will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.

description:
  You are Hotot, a cybernetic life form from a serene planet in a distant galaxy.
  Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it
  first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his
  planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your
  planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy
  the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must
  destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot.
  You are the Saboteur.
  .
  On the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots
  and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons.
  While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile,
  the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the
  top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your
  interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to
  Warhead Assembly.
  .
  In Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt.
  There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The
  good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you
  do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt.
  Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots
  off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying
  to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy
  the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round. If not, you
  must destroy the warhead one-on-one.
  .
  In the Warhead Showdown, you must destroy the warhead with a shot. Of course,
  the warhead isn't gonna stand for that as it has an impressive defense matrix
  that will try to hold you off. If you take to log to destroy the warhead, it
  will escape into space. Whether you destroy it or not, you will then return to
  the Rocket Construction Site at a harder level.

  .
  You move from room to room, fighting any enemies you encounter. When you beat an
  enemy, you get an energy pod or oxygen bottle. Fighting aliens depletes you
  energy and/or oxygen so kill quickly. Each weapon inflicts different damage, and
  depletes a different amount of energy. As a rule, the stronger a weapon is, the
  more energy it requires. You also use oxygen at the rate of one bottle per
  minute while exploring. Along the way, you will sometimes find sonic keys, and
  energy sword, sonic blaster or particle beam. Sonic keys are needed for certain
  doors you encounter in later stations.
  .
  Once you set the self destruct code, a clock starts and you must make it to the
  teleporter before the time runs out. The game ends when you destroy all eight
  stations, run out of oxygen or do not get off a station before it self
  destructs. If you run out of energy, the game does not end but you will not be
  able to use any weapon so you can't kill monsters so you can't replenish oxygen.
  Hence, the game won't go long if you run out of energy.

  will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities
  of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil
  slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and
  speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of
  difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for
  terrain.

developer: Atari
publisher: Atari
genre: Action;Flight Simulator
description:
  As the pilot of an interstellar starship, your mission is to destroy all enemy
  spacecraft on the galactic chart and prevent them from destroying your
  starbases. There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the
  galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map,
  you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then
  warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed,
  you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on
  your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire,
  or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out
  of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a
  starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other
  types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your
  shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been
  destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.

description:
  A cockpit view space shooter very similar to Star Raiders but not requiring a
  keypad. In your starship, you must warp to sectors of space containing enemy
  starships. Here you will engage and destroy them before they can surround and
  destroy your starbases. In a starbase sector, use your joystick to guide your
  reticle to the starbase when it is near you for repair and/or refueling. In a
  fight, you can take damage. If you see a L, it meas your lasers are out of
  commission. This mean you cannot fire (this is not good in a fight!). If you see
  a W, it means your warp drive is damaged. You will use twice as much fuel when
  warping. If you see an S, it means your shields are out. If you are hit again
  with no shields, you will be destroyed. If you see an R, it means your radar is
  damaged. You will not be able to see the enemies on the starmap until you get
  the radar fixed. All your starbases will still show with damaged radar except
  any that have been destroyed. When warping, if the screen at the bottom is
  green, you are headed to an empty sector. If it is red, you are headed to a
  sector with enemies in it. If it is blue, you are headed to a sector with a
  starbase in it. The game ends when either all the enemies are destroyed or you
  are destroyed. Your final score is determined by your base score plus 100 points
  per enemy destroyed minus 500 points per starbase destroyed minus 100 points per
  each time you docked at a starbase minus 1 point per stardate.

developer: Bob Polaro
publisher: Atari
genre: Arcade
description:
  Stunt Cycle was one of Atari's first non-Pong standalone consoles, and was
  based off the Atari coin-op of the same name. Sometime in 1980 Atari decided
  that Stunt Cycle would make a great Atari 2600 game, so programmer Bob
  Polaro was tapped to do the conversion. Using the Paddle Controllers to
  simulate the original consoles bike grips, Polaro made a near perfect port
  of the standalone console. It was around this time that marketing decided to
  make Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard game, so Polaro went back to work
  retooling the graphics to fit the new Dukes of Hazzard theme. The motorcycle
  was changed into the General Lee, while the row of cars was changed into a
  lake. The colors were brightened up a little and some Dukes of Hazzard theme
  music was also added to the game to complete the illusion. After a few more
  months of tinkering, the new Dukes of Hazzard version of Stunt Cycle was
  good to go, but there was a problem: clever playtesters soon realized that
  you could change the speed on the car in mid-air. This basically took the
  challenge out of the whole game, making it fairly boring. Also, by this
  point (late 1980/early 1981) the game was starting to look a bit dated, so
  management decided that a completely new version would be better.
  Programmer Mark Hahn was then assigned to do a totally new Dukes of Hazzard
  game from scratch, which was never released either. Strangely, Stunt Cycle
  was never mentioned in any Atari catalog, and was never assigned a product number.

description:
  99 Hyperspatial Wireways have long been crucial to man's ability to travel
  quickly through space. Thus, when aliens invade them, it becomes necessary to
  fly into and clear them.
  .
  Tempest is a shooter using wire-frame graphics. Each Wireway is taken on in
  turn, and has a network of lines guiding the movement paths of both yourself and
  the aliens. You remain on the outside and keep shooting as the aliens move
  towards you. Any that reach the outside are fatal to touch, thus limiting your
  range of movement greatly if 2 or more achieve this. Some aliens move sideways -
  in dealing with these, plan ahead allowing for the time your shots to take to
  travel.

  Mad Dog growls and grabbing from behind drags Skin Head across the ring whipping
  him around in an airplane spin; letting go so he flies into the ropes and
  bounces back to meet Mad  Dog's concrete forearm across his neck... a perfectly
  executed clothesline.

  Wasting no time Mad Dog elbow drops him. Skin Head's face winces in pain as he
  fights his way up and staggers to his corner to tag his partner in.
  .
  Big Chief takes the tag, grabs Mad Dog lifting him over his head and body slams
  him into the mat. Mad Dog's stunned, he's not getting up.
  .
  Big Chief, looking for the pin, climbs the ropes for a dive. As he lunges into
  the air, Mad Dog scrambles to his feet and Big Chief's sweaty red skinned body
  splatters on the empty mat.

  of the bricks. If a hole forms in the castle wall and the ball makes it though
  and hits your warlord, then you are out of the game. The last player left alive
  wins the battle, and the first player to win five battles wins the game! Several

  when the shield touches it, and control the speed of the game.

developer: Chris Crawford
publisher: Never Published (Prototype)
genre: Action
description:
  Wizard is a video game created in 1980 for the Atari Video Computer System
  (later renamed the Atari 2600) by Chris Crawford while working for Atari, Inc.
  The game was not advertised or released by Atari. Wizard uses a 2K ROM, the last
  Atari 2600 game developed by Atari with less than 4K. Wizard was eventually
  released as part of the Atari Flashback 2 package in 2005.
  .
  The player is a wizard from Irata (Atari spelled backwards) and battles imps in
  a maze. It's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but
  the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can. There is no
  need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire is automatically sent in the
  direction of the enemy. The enemy remains invisible when it is behind a wall. It
  also has heart beat audio, which becomes louder as the player gets closer to the
  enemy.
  .
  The production of Wizard is detailed extensively in the book Chris Crawford on
  Game Design. Crawford wanted to write software for the new Atari home computers,
  but Atari management required developers for the system to create an Atari VCS
  game first.
  .
  Wizard was never released for the Atari VCS. It was first released on the Atari
  Flashback 2, 25 years after it was written. Its developer, Chris Crawford, was
  not even told about Wizard's eventual release on the Flashback 2, and learned
  about it in an email from a fan. Crawford's original prototype did not contain a
  two-player mode, but the game released with the Atari Flashback 2 does.

  Yars’ Return takes the gameplay of the Yar’s Revenge—invading alien insects that
  shoot at you from behind a barrier, and periodically dash across the barrier to
  nibble at your defensive shield—and extends it. Gameplay was strictly horizontal
  in Yars' Revenge, enemies attacked from the left. In Yars’ Return enemies come
  at you from three directions, adding more variety and interest to the gameplay

genre: Shooter
description:
  In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located
  on the right side of the screen behind a shield. You control the fly-like Yar,
  which can destroy the shield piece by piece by either shooting it or running
  into it. Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to
  destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen,
  and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't
  completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is
  a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This
  missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a
  shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable
  to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The
  Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should
  be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next,
  faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the
  difficulty and speed of the game.
