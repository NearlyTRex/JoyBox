  B.C. Kid, or Bonk's Adventure is a 2D platform video game developed by Red
  Company and Atlus that was released in 1989-1990 for the TurboGrafx-16. In Japan
  it was released as PC Genjin (PC?) in 1989, a play on the Japanese name for the
  system, 'PC Engine'. The game was re-released for the TurboGrafx-16 in the U.S.
  in 1992 on the Gate of Thunder 4-in-1 game CD-ROM. The game was later ported to
  the NES, Game Boy, Amiga, arcade systems under different titles (FC Genjin, GB
  Genjin and BC Genjin). It is also available through Nintendo's Virtual Console
  service, on the PlayStation Store and there is a version for mobile phones in
  Japan.
  .
  Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk
  starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue
  as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in
  increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.
  .
  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special
  abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of power-up: his normal
  self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground,
  and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found
  in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but
  wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power and a
  large one takes him to stage three. Eating a small meat while in stage two will
  also put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. When the third
  stage effect wears off he returns to the second state and remains there for a
  while before turning back to the regular Bonk. Eating either size of meat while
  in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.
  .
  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart
  worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of
  Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game
  which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.
  .
  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.
  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up.
  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of
  that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman type
  congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.
