  A mysterious island rose from the sea shortly after the events of Sonic &

  inscribed with descriptions of the Chaos Rings, ancient Rings infused with Chaos
  Emerald energy. In order to find these Rings, Robotnik built his base, the
  Newtrogic High Zone, on the island. Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon,
  Vector the Crocodile, and Charmy Bee also arrived at the island, and ended up
  being captured by Robotnik and Metal Sonic, and placed in Robotnik's Combi
  Catcher machine. Knuckles, curious about the strange island, goes there as well,
  and manages to rescue Espio. The two then go on to stop Robotnik from getting
  the Chaos Rings.

description:
  This patch completely replaces the original engine, adding performance improvements and new features, as well as missing levels from the Jaguar port.
  .
  Changes:
  .
  * Network support via the Zero Tolerance (aka Technopop) link cable.\n
  * Splitscreen coop and deathmatch modes.\n
  * New title screen that resembles the Saturn and PlayStation versions.\n
  * Rendering has been spread across both SH2 processors for better speed.\n
  * User input is processed at 30FPS, while game logic runs at 15FPS.\n
  * Low (two pixel modes) 128×144, 128×160, 160×180 and three high detail
  224×128, 256×144, 320×180 video modes.\n
  * Anamorphic widescreen support for 16:9 screens.\n
  * Improved visual fidelity (aka ‘high color’) mode.\n
  * FM Synth soundtrack courtesy of Spoony Bard.\n
  * Selecting between no music, VGM FM music, 32X+, or playing music from
  attached Sega CD (requires Sega CD in addition to 32X).\n
  * Stereo panning for game sounds.\n
  * Controller hot plugging support.\n
  * Save ram support - keeps track of finished levels, health, armor, weapons
  and ammo - eight save slots as well as an auto-save at the end of each
  level.\n
  * Includes levels that were omitted from the original release.\n
  * Restores sprite directions from the Jaguar version as well as in-fighting
  between monsters.\n
  * A new port of “Slough of Despair” and level fixes courtesy of Wavy.\n
  * Spectres look the way they did in the original PC version.\n
  * Jaguar Doom HUD assets.\n
  * Three drawing modes: the regular sector based lighting (although it’s
  better than the original Doom 32X in that sprites also use this lighting, no
  more 100% bright sprites!), “potato” mode which doesn’t texture floors or
  ceilings for slightly better speed, or the original Doom fading light
  rendering (which is just a smidgen slower and looks a little muddy given
  the fifteen bit palette of the 32X).\n
  * ‘Always run’ option.\n
  * Anti-aliased automap with smooth scaling.\n
  * Support for three-button and six-button pads, as well as the Sega mouse.
  You can choose how to map the primary three buttons in the menu.\n
  * Verified as working on Kega Fusion 3.64, a Model 2 Genesis + Model 2 CD
  + launch 32X, a CDX + 32X, with a NeoFlash NeoMyth MD and the V1 Mega
  EverDrive, and also with Mega EverDrive Pro and MegaSD.\n
  * Support for 32X+ (CDDA tracks from CUE files) on the MegaSD flashcart.\n
  * Kill, item and secret counters on the automap.\n
  * “Skinface” intermission screen background.\n
  * Multi-region, supports both PAL and NTSC.

game: Metal Head (Japan, USA) (En,Ja)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Sega 32X/Metal Head (Japan, USA) (En,Ja)/Metal Head (Japan, USA) (En,Ja).json
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
genre: Action
description:
  It has been five years after the formation of the Worldwide Federation. Although
  war has been averted, terrorist cells around the world threaten the stability of
  the federation. To combat this menace, the Federation has created a bi-pedal
  armored tank known as the Metal Head. You are a Metal Head pilot, and you have
  to use all the weapons at your disposal to take out the terrorists.
  .
  Metal Head is a bit of a variation on the usual giant robot combat game. The
  game's mission areas bear more resemblance to a first-person shooter than a
  simulation. The graphics are all rendered in texture mapped polygons, which is
  unusual for a 32X game.
