  swallowing up the galaxy's planets left and right. What's worse, the resistance
  forces have had their secret weapons stolen from them and put into pods spread
  out on many different planets. You must pilot the T-Griffon morphing attack
  craft to each planet and recover the pods to stop the Pernitians.
  .
  So, in each planet, or level, you must collect a certain number of pods and make
  it to the exit before the enemies shoot you down. Fortunately, there are
  power-ups that can strategically enhance the T-Griffon's offensive capabilities.
  After clearing 8 planets, you take on a boss creature/ship before moving on to
  the next sector. There are 4 levels like this to clear, each with progressively
  increasing difficulty.

developer: Virtuality Entertainment Ltd.
publisher: Atari, Inc.
genre: Shooter
description:
  Missile Command 3D is an update to the classic Atari arcade game. The goal in
  Missile Command is to defend your cities against an onslaught of missiles coming
  from the sky. Your arsenal consists of three anti-missile flak cannons. You have
  to position the anti-missile clouds in the path of the incoming missiles to stop
  them from impacting.
  .
  This Jaguar game has 3 modes. First, there is a port of the original arcade
  game. There are neat extras for this mode like graphic backdrops and the ability
  to resize or scale the screen. The second mode is Missile Command 3D. This mode
  retains the gameplay of the original, but adds 3D graphics to the mix. The final
  mode, Virtual Missile Command, changes things up quite a lot. Instead of anti-
  missile flak, your cannons shoot lasers. This means you don't need to lead your
  targets anymore. You play the game from a first-person perspective, and must
  switch between the three cannons via buttons on the keypad. There are nine
  levels in this mode, each with a boss at the end.
