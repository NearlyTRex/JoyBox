  the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France,
  New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish

developer: Interphase
publisher: Interphase
genre: Shooter
description:
  Aquattack is an action game with four levels which partly have varying gameplay
  mechanics. In level one and two, the player mans a motor boat which needs to
  travel a certain distance from left to right. Of course there is a lot of enemy
  opposition which needs to be avoided. Some enemies can be shot while others are
  out of reach. Fuel is limited and needs to replenished by collecting
  refreshments dropped by allied planes. Level three is similar; the player uses a
  hang glider now. There are different enemies to fight and no fuel to collect. In
  level four, there is a guarded energy field to cross in order to bring four
  bombs to the other side. However, only one bomb can be transported at once and
  there is a time limit.
  .
  After beating all four levels, they loop with more difficult enemies and faster
  playing speed. The player can take nine hits and the overall goal is to earn as
  many points as possible before the unavoidable final death occurs.

  increase or decrease the profits from a certain business, such as new laws
  requiring expensive new safety measures in factories or Bigfoot sightings
  scaring off attendees from resorts. On the other hand an extremely popular movie
  or TV show might drive crowds at theaters or casinos.

  The game includes multiple difficulty settings determining factors such as
  starting capital and the financial goal set for that scenario's win condition.
  Two players can compete.

  Frantic Freddy is an arcade action game where Freddy must run back and forth on
  the ground, dodging falling rubbish while shooting water at flames in the
  windows of a building. When all fires are extinguished, the game progresses to
  the next floor, where Freddy can climb between the floors, shooting to the left
  and right instead of upwards. On these levels, there are two kinds of flames –
  the red and the purple ones. The purple ones are more aggressive, following
  Freddy around the screen, and can only be put out once all the red ones are
  extinguished. The game progresses in this way, alternating between the
  upwards-shooting levels and the sideways-shooting levels.
  .
  On the higher difficulty levels, cats turn up at intervals in the windows,
  falling down after a while. Freddy must catch the cats, or he will lose a life.
  Similarly, he loses a life if hit by a fire or falling rubbish.

  There are several different actions available to the player. These include:
  fighting with the equipped weapon, a LOCATE spell to discover traps in the room,
  a SEARCH spell to discover hidden doors inside of room which would otherwise
  look like ordinary walls. Players may also use many of the items and scrolls
  that can be picked up in the dungeon. The treasure can be picked up which

  magical scrolls. Most items are only good for a single use.

  without plummeting to your doom? The second part pits you against a whole bunch
  of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river. Fortunately, you have a knife to fight
  back with. Don't forget to go up for air! In the third part, you face a battle
  against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics. Once you've cleared all
  these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is
  armed with a wicked spear. Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?
  .
  Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile

  As Bounty Bob, the player's goal is to inspect every section of each mine in
  search of the evil Yukon Yohan while avoiding the various radioactive creatures
  that inhabit the mine. As Bounty Bob walks over a section of flooring, it fills
  with color. To complete the level, every section of flooring must be colored.
  There are ten mines in total (eleven in the ColecoVision port). Each level is
  timed and must be completed before the player runs out of oxygen.\n
  Along the way, Bob encounters many objects left behind by past miners. By
  collecting these, bonus points are achieved and the radioactive creatures smile
  and turn green. While in this state, Bob can collect them and earn extra
  points.\n
  Various obstacles in each mine aid and hinder Bob's progress. Ladders allow him
  to climb up or down to the next platform, Matter transporters teleport him to
  other matter transporters in that mine, chutes slide Bob off a platform (often
  against his will), and pulverizers crush Bob if he gets in their way.\n
  Most levels contain some custom element, which varies from level to level.
  Pressing the space bar for several seconds skips a level. On the Atari 800, the
  player can key in the phone number on the title screen, followed by a level
  number to skip to that level.

game: Omega Race (USA, Europe)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Coleco ColecoVision/Omega Race (USA, Europe)/Omega Race (USA, Europe).json
developer: Micro Fun
publisher: Micro Fun
genre: Shooter
description:
  This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and
  shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive
  Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid
  flights goes into a spiraling pattern.
  .
  There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the
  highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.
  .
  You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward
  (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the
  ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite
  direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire
  toward anything it is in motion toward.
  .
  Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of
  the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have
  control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control,
  before you run into an enemy ship and die.

  Pepper II is a maze game with zip! The object of Pepper II is simple enough, all
  you do is zip closed sections of the maze and they will become filled with
  color. Zip in all the sections of the maze and it's complete. However if you
  back track you might unzip your path, so be careful! Each stage has four mazes
  you must complete to move on, but you can move from maze to maze by using the
  exits located at the top, bottom and sides of the screen. And don't forget about
  the bad guys trying to take you out all the while. If one touches you you're
  toast! You can fight back by zipping sections of the maze closed that contain
  power-ups that will make you invincible for a short time or clear all the screen
  of the baddies. The game keeps getting harder as you progress to higher stages.

description:
  You are Yucatan Sam on a quest to explore the temple of Quintana Roo. Your goal
  is to find the vault which is hidden somewhere within and return with the
  treasure that is inside. You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way
  up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly
  lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have
  a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly.
  .
  Hidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to
  unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret
  rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of
  acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you
  carry a geiger counter with you; the higher the reading, the closer you are to
  something of interest.
  .
  The rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies.
  To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks
  against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your
  mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at
  later levels.

genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  Space Fury is a multi-directional shooter game released on for Colecovision in
  1983 and is based on the 1981 arcade game created by Sega.  The arcade version
  game was an early example of color vector graphics and it also featured speech
  synthesis, both of which are not features in the Colecovision release.
  .
  The gameplay is similar to Asteroids in that you have one screen of space that
  wraps back on itself and your ship can only thrust and fire. However, whereas in
  Asteroids you faced pieces of rock that couldn't give chase, Space Fury instead
  provides alien vessels that will hunt you down. Each alien vessel starts in 4
  pieces at diagonal corners which will try to join together. Shooting any of
  these pieces before is possible and will make things easier for your player.
  When one or more pieces reaches the center point, it combines with other pieces
  there and begins to fire upon and give chase to your vessel. There's only one
  screen of space, so your tactics are limited. However your vessel is not
  completely basic. Provided from the beginning are three superstructures, of
  which you can choose one, that provide additional firepower to your ship.

  Squish'em Featuring Sam lets you assume the role of the title character, a man
  obsessed with climbing to the top of a 48-story building to obtain a suitcase
  full of money. As you guide Sam up the side of the building, Creeping Creatures
  that crawl along the ledges will get in your way. You can jump over them or
  squish them flat. After avoiding or stomping on a creature, you should climb on
  up to the next floor. A squished, temporarily harmless creature will soon turn
  white and resume crawling. White creatures can be jumped over, but not squished.
  .
  In addition to encountering creatures, you must keep on the lookout for falling
  objects. Bricks, hammers, tires, motors, dynamite, fire hydrants, television
  sets and sinks can bonk you on the head and knock you off the building. At some
  point along the way, you can pick up a prize that will give you a bonus life.
  You begin the game with four lives and can earn up to 128 in reserve.
  .
  Sam is a climbing man, but he's also verbose. When he squishes a creature he
  says "SQUISH'EM!" If he gets clocked by a creature or is conked on the head by a
  falling object, he lets out a "WHOOPS!" If he manages to snag a prize, he'll say
  "WOW!" After scaling the building and collecting his monetary reward, he
  gleefully shouts "MONEY, MONEY, MONEY!"

  Matches can be played at quarter-final, semi-final or final level—winning at one

  sets, with a player requiring a 2-game lead to win a set, though a tie-break
  comes in at 6–6 in all but the final set.

  The view is pseudo-3D, from above the court, and features a shadow on the ball
  to give its motion a more realistic appearance and make it easier to judge the
  ball's height. Spectators turn their heads to view the action, and ball boys run
  on to the court to retrieve dead balls. Shot speed, direction and spin can all
  be applied, and both forehand and backhand strokes are available.
