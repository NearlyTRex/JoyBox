description:
  Vinne and Slash are bleeding from knife wounds and the ref is out cold! No
  wonder the gang members nicknamed this game "Basketbrawl." To them, it's not a
  game -- it's a street fight. This premise kicks off Atari's action sports game
  for up to two players. The objective in Basketbrawl is to become the baddest
  gang in the town by winning the Basketbrawl tournament. To win, you must play
  three games against each of the five gangs in your city. Each time you move up
  to the next gang, you will play a team with more players and more dangerous
  weapons. Each game lasts six minutes -- out score you opponent by shooting more
  baskets. Each basket is worth two points. If the game is tied after six minutes,
  the first team to score wins
