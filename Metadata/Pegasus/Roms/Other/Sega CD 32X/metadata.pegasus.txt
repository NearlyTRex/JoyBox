description:
  Corpse Killer is a full-motion-video (FMV) shoot-'em up. It seems the evil
  genius Dr. Hellman has found a way to raise the dead and created an island of
  zombies. The player is an elite special forces soldier who has been parachuted
  onto the island; it is up to them to shoot their way through the undead hordes
  and stop Dr. Hellman.
  .
  The game is played from a first-person perspective. Various zombies pop up in
  front of a video background and the player must shoot them down either by moving
  a mouse cursor on screen or by using a light gun.
