  Chakan is a somewhat unorthodox platform game with its mix of relentless
  difficulty, spell crafting and dark themes. In the game you're controlling
  Chakan whose been cursed to not die. In order for him to rest in peace, he'll
  have to go through many levels of hack and slash platforming. The ultimate goal
  is defeat all the primary realms and achieve inner-peace.
  .
  Through your travels you have to defeat bosses in each of the four realms of
  air, water, fire and earth to proceed and acquire weapons that'll help you on
  progress in other realms. Chakan can acquire the mallet, scythe, grappling hook
  and axe along with his standard swords and depending on what weapons is
  equipped, different abilities are unlocked. Some weapons allows for double
  jumping for instance, while others can tear down walls.
  .
  Furthermore, the player is able to collect potions that can be used in alchemy.
  By pressing "Start" at any time, one can create various spells that enhance the
  character like higher jumping, putting fire on your blades or even invisibility.
  Some levels actually requires you to use specific spells to progress, forcing
  you to think outside the borders of a normal platform game. On top of all this,
  there's an imposed time limit on each level.

  The emergence of biomonsters was soon followed by a new class of warriors called
  hunters. Hunters devote themselves to protecting the people of Mota from attack.
  .
  Anna Zirski (アーミア・アミルスキー (Āmia Amirusuki, Amia Amirski)), however, is a hunter
  of a different sort - one who hunts hunters, those who have gone rogue and
  become as much of a threat as the monsters themselves. This chapter details
  Anna's origin as a bounty hunter, and follows her chase for a wanted Motavian
  hacker. Her adventure in pursuit of this criminal leads her to find out about
  her target's remorseful past, inspiring her to renounce her bounty hunting
  career, and instead becoming a 'Counter Hunter' - choosing to focus her efforts
  on hunters that have gone truly bad, rather than dutifully arresting anyone with
  a bounty on their head.

  Josh Kain (or Kain Ji An, Kainzu) is an 18 year old aspiring engineer who always
  loved machines, and had become quite knowledgeable in how electrical devices and
  robots function. He built many small devices, fixed appliances, and even learned
  to hack computers. However, due to being scatterbrained and clumsy, he would
  sometimes destroy the things he tried to fix. Eventually, after one particularly
  disastrous repair job, he gave up trying to be an engineer, deciding instead to
  put his "talent" for destroying things to good use. Thus did he become a
  "wrecker", his job being to trash anything electronic. He starts off joining a
  gang of rebels out to destroy Mother Brain, before he eventually ends up teaming
  up with Rolf in Phantasy Star II towards that very end.

  Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the
  role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A.
  Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a
  linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very
  well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs,
  crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion
  and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with
  normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil
  slicks and stray cows.

  Sonic 3 & Knuckles is a game that results when Sonic 3 is locked-on to Sonic &
  Knuckles via Lock-On Technology. It acts as one large combined game and all the
  levels from Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles become available.
  .
  There are several noticeable differences when playing the games combined.
  Knuckles is playable in the Sonic 3 levels and Tails becomes available in the
  Sonic & Knuckles levels. Also, all of the levels from both games are accessible,
  starting from Sonic 3. Once these levels are completed the Death Egg falls off
  screen intact instead of being destroyed, and then the play continues straight
  to the levels of Sonic & Knuckles. The final boss of Sonic 3 is also omitted for
  Sonic and Tails.
  .
  After collecting all the Chaos Emeralds of Sonic 3 a new quest becomes available
  when entering the first special Stage in Mushroom Hill Zone which allows you to
  collect seven new Emeralds called "Super Emeralds". When these Emeralds are
  collected, Hidden Palace Zone will become available, and Sonic can transform
  into Hyper Sonic and Knuckles can transform into Hyper Knuckles. Tails has no
  Hyper form, but the Super Emeralds are needed for him to transform into Super
  Tails, as the Chaos Emeralds alone have no effect on him.

  Sonic 2 Heroes is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive by
  flamewing that allows the player to direct Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles simultaneously,
  similar to Sonic Heroes. It also features multiple elements from Sonic 3 & Knuckles
  including element shields, character abilities, and game save features.
  .
  Beginning almost immediately after the initial release, posters to its official
  thread on the Sonic Retro forums suggested (with varying degrees of jocularity
  and seriousness) that flamewing and Sonic 1 and 2 author ColinC10 combine
  their two hacks. Reminded of this suggestion several months later, flamewing
  posted expressed interest and an intention to ask ColinC10. The two agreed to
  collaborate. flamewing took most programming responsibility to integrate the
  source code of the two hacks and only announced the existence of the project
  once it was well underway. This new version, entitled Sonic Classic Heroes,
  supersedes Sonic 2 Heroes and saw its first release on 20 July 2012.

description:
  Sonic Classic Heroes is a ROM hack for the Sega Mega Drive that is the result
  of a collaboration between flamewing and ColinC10, combining their respective
  hacks Sonic 2 Heroes and Sonic 1 and 2. It therefore is a single ROM that
  offers the entire campaigns of Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2,
  either alone or together; and enables the player to play as many characters
  such as Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles. The hack is named due to the ability to
  control a team of characters, which is reminiscent of the more recent 3D
  game Sonic Heroes.
  .
  The hack is built on Sonic 2’s engine, which has been enhanced by both
  flamewing and ColinC10 to have new features. These include: multiple
  gameplay elements from Sonic 3 & Knuckles, such as element shields and
  character-specific abilities; the ability to save progress, scores, etc.
  to SRAM (something rarely implemented in Sonic 2, with the other notable
  example being Esrael’s Sonic 2 Delta); various bug-fixes and improvements
  to the mechanics of the original games; and many more features, both
  implemented and planned.

  Sonic 1 and 2 is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Sega Mega Drive by
  ColinC10, submitted as his entry for the 2010 Sonic the Hedgehog Hacking
  Contest. In addition to all Zones usually featured in Sonic the Hedgehog 2,
  this hack first features all Zones from Sonic the Hedgehog (16-bit), which
  have been ported, resulting in a continuous game experience from Green Hill
  Zone to Death Egg Zone. Both games' different kinds of Special Stages are
  available in all regular acts, and they are accessed through their usual
  method (Giant Rings for Sonic 1's, star post checkpoints for Sonic 2's).
  The player must beat all special stages from each game, thus collecting 13
  Chaos Emeralds, in order to obtain Super Sonic.
  .
  After many users of the Sonic Retro forums made the suggestion, ColinC10
  and Sonic 2 Heroes author flamewing decided to collaborate on a combined
  version of their respective hacks, provisionally entitled Sonic 1 & 2 Heroes
  and eventually became Sonic Classic Heroes. FlameWing took most of the
  programming responsibility to merge and adapt the source code of the two
  hacks, and only announced the project once development was well underway.

  time, you have to wipe the demons from each room and find the quickest path to

  the quickest route. Improvements over the second title include moving between
  rooms in multiple directions, multiple endings based on your performance,
  special moves for Rick and crisper graphics.

  It still has a horror theme and maintains the same level of gore and violence.
  You can collect weapons such as a skull-smashing baseball bat, an ax and cement
  blocks. If you get knocked down, a ghost will try to snatch your weapon and drop
  it in another room of the house. Other collectible items include extra lives,
  health meat or orbs. These orbs build up a power meter. Upon completion, you
  have the ability to transform into a berserk mutant for a short time. The
  cutscenes feature real actors who act out the characters.

  Virtua Racing is a home port of Sega's first ever 3D, polygon-based racing game
  for the arcade. The game consists of racing Formula-1-looking cars around a
  beginner, intermediate, or expert track, competing against a second player or
  computer drivers. Despite having Formula-1 cars, the game controls are very
  "arcadey" and players can see the leap they made from here to Daytona.
  .
  The Megadrive/Genesis version of Virtua Racing is of note as it is the only game
  for the system which features the SVP chip (Sega Virtua Processor). The chip is
  a 3D processor built into each cartridge (the console itself had no 3D
  capability) and is very similar to the SNES's SuperFX chips, used in games such
  as Starfox and Stunt Race FX.

  wrestlers or movie characters.

  The ring is done in pseudo 3D. The graphics are sprites, but the wrestlers can
  move along the Z and X axes and the ring will instantly rotate 90 degrees to
  give a better view of the action if the player's view gets blocked. The
  available moves are punch, kick, and grab. The objective is to wear down the
  opponents' life bar, then pin them.

description:
  Zoop is a fast-paced puzzle game in which the player eliminates colored shapes
  that are approaching his alter ego, another colored shape, before they reach the
  top, somewhat similarly to Tetris.
  .
  In order to eliminate the other shapes, you must point your piece at it and
  'fire'. If the shape is the same color as your piece, the shape is eliminated,
  as well as all of the shapes of the same color behind it, until your piece hits
  a piece of a different color. If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit
  when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the
  shape.
