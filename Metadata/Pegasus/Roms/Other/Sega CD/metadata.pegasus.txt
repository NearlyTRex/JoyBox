developer: Hudson Soft

genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  Dungeon Explorer is an action role-playing game. It supports up to four players
  with a choice of six different character classes: monk, knight, elf, mage, beast
  and ninja. The game starts in the area surrounding a save point. This area
  functions as a central hub to access all the six dungeons. If a character leaves
  it, the food counter starts decreasing. If it reaches zero, the life points
  start diminishing until the character dies. Food can be found as potions or pots
  around the mazes. Returning the character to the save point area replenishes all
  the counters and cures all conditions (like poisoning and confusion). The gold
  collected in the game can be spent on equipment upgrades at the weapons shop.
  The tavern allows the player to switch characters.

description:
  Sega Classics Arcade Collection is a compilation of four (or five) Sega Mega
  Drive games for the Sega Mega-CD. It was a pack-in game bundled with launch Mega
  CDs in the United Kingdom and North America, and was released separately in
  other regions.
  .
  Two variants of Sega Classics Arcade Collection exist; an earlier version seen
  in North America and Japan, which contains Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Columns
  and The Revenge of Shinobi, and a later version seen in Europe and later North
  American bundles, which throws in Super Monaco GP. In North America the older
  "4-in-1" variant came in the same box as Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective
  Vol. I, while the later "5-in-1" one came with Ecco the Dolphin.
  .
  Each game is mostly identical to their Mega Drive counterparts, though have
  minor changes thanks to the Mega CD's enhancements. All digitised speech samples
  have been replaced with higher quality audio, the first level in Golden Axe uses
  different instruments and Super Monaco GP has extra drums. The Revenge of
  Shinobi is based on a later version than its cartridge counterparts, altering
  some of the bosses which infringe copyrights. For unknown reasons, Golden Axe is
  only a one-player game in this compilation.
  .
  Despite being the Mega CD's selling point, only two games have an updated CD
  soundtrack (Golden Axe in the form of music recorded from its arcade board, and
  Columns which has a new title theme). This means only a small fraction of the
  disc is used.

  "Solar City", an island paradise ruled by the evil Commissioner Stenchler

description:
  Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective can be described as a hybrid of adventure
  game and simulation. Gameplay process involves traveling to various locations in
  London, interrogating suspects, gathering clues, checking out the newspapers,
  and eventually presenting all the evidence to the judge; if the latter finds the
  circumstances incriminating, he will accept the results of the investigation,
  and the case will be considered solved. Though the basic gameplay is rather
  typical for adventure games, the amount of real detective work and the focus of
  the game on purely case-related actions rather than exploration and manipulation
  of items makes it comparable to a simulation of a criminal investigation.
