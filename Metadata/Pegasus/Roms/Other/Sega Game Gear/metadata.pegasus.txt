developer: Ancient
publisher: Sega
genre: Beat 'em Up
description:
  Axel, Adam and Blaze - ex-cops, the solution to punk pollution. The city's a war
  zone, and they're going out two at a time to give the gangs a kick in the guts.
  This is the ultimate in street combat. These city fighters are martial arts
  maniacs with a battery of individually controllable attacks - including jabs,
  head butts, and overhead kicks. They're up against a mob of Kung-Fu creeps and
  axe-hurling fiends. On the streets it's only two of them against hordes of
  attacking scum. Slam into pipe-wielding weirdos and bash 'em with their own
  metal. Throw an uppercut or an elbow smash - these goons keep comin'!

game: Crystal Warriors (USA, Europe)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Sega Game Gear/Crystal Warriors (USA, Europe)/Crystal Warriors (USA, Europe).json
developer: Sega
publisher: Sega
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the
  four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened
  by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use
  the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape
  with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal
  and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.
  .
  Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player
  fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters,
  healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever
  two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns.
  In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack),
  "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite
  self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human
  enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters
  do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak
  characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. In-between battles
  the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party
  members.

genre: Adventure
description:
  You are an agent of Paseo government on the planet Motavia. One day, on December
  1268 A.W, you receive a letter at the base. The sender is Ken Miller, a
  scientist as well as an old friend of yours. He had immigrated to Dezolis to
  conduct his research years ago. These are the contents of the letter: "How are
  you? I have succeeded in the discovery of the century. You must come and see
  it."
  .
  You travel to the planet Dezolis and visit a town called Carsonville. There, you
  find out that Dr. Miller has invented a machine that can make human beings
  immensely powerful. The problem is, Dr. Miller is kidnapped, along with his
  invention. With the help of his sister Layla you have to solve this mystery.
  .
  This game is a Japanese-style adventure game set in the Phantasy Star universe.
  The player interacts with the game world by choosing available options such as
  "See", "Talk", "Move", etc. There are a few puzzles to solve and a few
  encounters with hostile characters (in a "pseudo-RPG" turn-based fashion), but
  the largest part of the game is dedicated to exploration and dialogue with the
  characters.

description:
  Long ago, the evil Cablon ravaged the Copto planet, a light year away of the
  Algol system. When he was defeated, he was sealed on a planet discovered by
  Alis, the heroine of the first "Phantasy Star", a planet that was also known as
  Alisland. In this gaiden (side-story) set in Phantasy Star universe, you play
  the role of two young people from the village Tedo - Alec and Minina. One day,
  Minina finds an old artifact. While wondering what that could be, the young
  people learn that Alec' father was attacked and kidnapped by bandits. Determined
  to find him, the two heroes embark on a dangerous journey that will eventually
  lead them much further than they suspect.
  .
  Phantasy Star Gaiden plays pretty much like any other Phantasy Star starting
  with the second game: both towns and dungeons are in top-down view, the
  turn-based battles are viewed from first-person perspective. The gameplay is
  standard console-style RPG: you should fight random enemies, gain experience and
  gold, buy better equipment, visit many towns and dungeons, etc.

game: Road Rash (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Other/Sega Game Gear/Road Rash (USA)/Road Rash (USA).json
developer: Probe
publisher: U.S. Gold
genre: Action;Racing
description:
  Road Rash is the name of a motorcycle-racing video game series by Electronic
  Arts in which the player participates in violent, illegal street races. The
  series started on the Mega Drive and made its way to various other systems over
  the years. The game's title is based on the slang term for the severe friction
  burns that can occur in a motorcycle fall where skin comes into contact with the
  ground at high speed.
  .
  In an attempt to improve on the basic Hang-On concept, where the player's
  vehicle remains on the same horizontal plane and turns are essentially a matter
  of moving left or right, Road Rash requires that players contend with various
  grade changes. The physics reflect the act of going up or down a hill, as well
  as turning while climbing; this results in the ability to launch one's
  motorcycle great distances, resulting in crashes (and their animations). Aside
  from this, Road Rash has a standard system of obstacles including street signs,
  trees, poles, and livestock; and taking from OutRun, active traffic while racing
  against other bikers.
  .
  What Road Rash really brings to the table is "brawling"; the player can fight
  other bikers with a variety of hand weapons or simple punches and kicks. The
  player initially starts off with just those basics, but can grab a weapon from
  another rider by timing a punch correctly. The list of weapons has grown with
  the games, starting from the clubs in the first Road Rash, and eventually
  including things like crowbars, nunchaku, and cattle prods. Whatever the weapon,
  successful attacks damage an opponent's stamina, and depleting this stamina will
  cause a biker to wipeout which can also damage the bike; this functions much
  like hitting a car or other major obstacle, and it all applies to you as much as
  to other racers (though in most of the games, you have more stamina than
  opponents).
  .
  As mentioned before, the last and most major obstacle are cops. The motorcycle
  police officers fight the player as another opponent and serve as gameplay
  enforcers by culling players who fall too far behind or choose to explore the
  world rather than race in it. Losing a fight with an officer or being caught by
  one while off one's motorcycle causes the player to be Busted, ending the race.

description:
  The objective of the game is to win the three different Chaos GPs (green, yellow
  and red emerald). Each Chaos GP has six different tracks based on the original
  Sonic game levels' design. The players will race around a track against the
  other three characters for a top position, using 2 to accelerate, 1 to brake and
  the latter combined with a direction allows to drift corners, though abusing it
  will send the character into spinning out of control. Going out of the asphalt
  track drops the speed immediately and in the sidelines there are several
  obstacles that will stop the character altogether if they are hit. The Up
  direction on the directional pad can use rings collected on the track as a
  special move, unique to each character.
