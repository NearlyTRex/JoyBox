  a mission on the map and you can then set your army out to do your bidding. As
  your unit groups travel along the map on the way to their given objective,
  they'll happen along enemy unit groups. When they meet, the game switches to an

developer: SNK
publisher: SNK
genre: Strategy;Life Simulation
description:
  In this game you keep watch on the wacky Neo Poke-kun, a cartoony programmer
  thing that lives locked in his small Tokyo apartment. You don't have direct
  control of his actions but instead interact with him indirectly by switching
  stuff in his apartment on and off, which triggers different reactions from
  him. More importantly you can invite different characters to visit Neo
  Poke-kun, which will also trigger different reactions from him. Depending
  on the time of day and the visitor you may get different reactions from
  Poke-kun, and if you make him happy enough he'll get to work and code a
  mini-game for you.
  .
  These collection of 30 games form the bulk of the gameplay, and include
  different clones of other games, shooters, short platformers, and compact
  puzzle challenges similar to Wario Ware.
  .
  The game has a distinctly bizarre sense of humor with wacky animations
  played whenever something happens to your Poke-kun, and while some games
  use basic vector graphics, most use 2D sprites.

description:
  A port of the successful 2D fighter Last Blade for the NeoGeo Pocket Color. The
  port features nearly all the characters featured in the original game clashing
  against each other using a limited color palette and a new super-deformed
  character design, but otherwise identically as in their arcade counterpart. You
  select your character from a selection of swordsmen and then proceed to fight
  and defeat all your opponents in a one-on-one fighting tournament involving
  weapon fighting a la Samurai Shodown.
  .
  Unique to the port is the fact that it allows you to unlock and play as
  characters from Last Blade 2 and in fact eventually unlock the full storyline
  for the sequel, making the game sort of a compilation of both released games in
  the series.

  The gameplay of Puzzle Link 2 is generally identical to the first game: Puzzle
  Link is a game where blocks of matching color have to be dissolved. New blocks
  constantly scroll into the screen from the top. The game is over when the first
  blocks reach the bottom of the screen. You can dissolve blocks by shooting at
  them. The shots form a line where they impact. If that line connects otherwise
  unconnected blocks of the same color they will dissolve.
  .
  There are new modes in Puzzle Link 2. Like the original, there are the standard
  challenge and puzzle rounds. But new to the series is the marathon-style game
  where you continue eliminating pieces as the game gradually increases speed. In
  this mode, more power-ups appear as the player performs faster. Here, you get
  three shots that will eliminate the same color tile from the board. The game
  also has link cable support for two players.
