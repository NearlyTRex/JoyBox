genre: Action
description:
  From the time we enter grade school until our matriculation, we are
  indoctrinated with a drive to "make it" -- to ascend the corporate ladder,
  earn a large salary, and produce successful offspring. This game won't
  help you with any of that. It can, however, train you in the ways of the
  swivel chair, the most versatile piece of furniture since the ottoman
  with built-in soda fridge.
  .
  Join Harry the Handsome Executive as he scoots and kicks his swivel chair
  through the halls of ScumCo in this delightful action game developed by
  Ben Spees. The path to job security is fraught with many perils! Harry
  must avoid discomfort caused by dart-throwing middle managers, rebellious
  customer service drones, crazed chemists, and a host of other enemies.
  All the while, he must maintain corporate favor or risk the feared pink
  slip.
