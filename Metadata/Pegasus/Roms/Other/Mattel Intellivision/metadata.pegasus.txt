developer: Gene Smith
publisher: Mattel Electronics
genre: Action;Puzzle
description:
  The terrorist Boris has placed a bomb in the city! As a member of the bomb
  squad, it is the player's job to disarm the bomb before it explodes.
  .
  Start the game with a view of the code number display which is damaged. In order
  to find the code which disarms the bomb, the player has to repair the various
  circuits in order to fix the display. By selecting a square on the code number
  display, the player will be brought to the corresponding circuit which can be
  repaired using cutters, pliers, and soldering iron. The player's partner, Frank,
  will guide through the repairs by telling the player what needs to be done, in
  what order repairs should be performed, and by helping the player position the
  tools. Depending on the circuit, the player may need to cut out parts or replace
  parts (spare parts are located at the top of the screen). If the player use an
  incorrect replacement part, or perform the repairs in the wrong order, the
  player will lose time or even cause the bomb to explode.
  .
  On the more difficult skill levels, circuit parts may even overheat and cause a
  fire; luckily, the player also have a fire extinguisher with you to deal with
  this situation! When enough circuits have been repaired, the player can decipher
  the code, enter it into the computer, and the bomb will be disarmed (an
  incorrect guess will cause it to explode, however). The player may choose to
  have a one, two, or three digit code to guess and several difficulty levels are
  available.

developer: Michael Breen
publisher: Mattel Electronics
genre: Shooter
description:
  Buzz Bombers is an arcade action game similar to Centipede. You control a can of
  bug spray at the bottom of the screen, and you need to defend yourself from the
  swarms of incoming bees. The bees start at the top of the screen, and fly their
  way back and forth, slowly heading towards the bottom of the screen. If they
  reach the ground, they will pollinate the flowers there which causes them to
  grow and will restrict movement of your spray can. When you shoot a bee, it will
  turn into a honeycomb. The honeycombs will cause the bees to head towards the
  ground even faster, since they will turn around when one is in their way. Your
  spray can is able to shoot the honeycombs, but if you leave them in place a
  hummingbird will fly around and eat the honey from them. The more honey the
  hummingbird eats, the more points you get. The game ends when all of your spray
  cans are destroyed by growing flowers.

  Designed to entice you into getting an Intellivision, the 1978 Demonstration
  Cartridge runs through a loop to nab you with Intellivision's superior

  announced Keyboard Component. The 1979 revision of the demonstration
  cartridge removed that reference.
  .
  The demonstration ran through four screens of text, followed by scripted
  snippets of NFL Football, Las Vegas Poker & Blackjack, and Armor Battle. It
  seems odd that they didn't have their 'killer app' - Major League Baseball -
  in on this demo. During the text, Richard Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra
  plays in the background in glorious three-part harmony. (Actually, it's
  rather plain. Later classical adaptations, such as the music in Thunder
  Castle, are vastly superior.)

  horse can be driven by the players. There are 3 types of terrain: turf, mud or

  [Unreleased 1982]  Land Battle is a two player war game which utilizes both
  strategic and tactical modes of play. Each player controls an array of forces
  with the objective of capturing or destroying his opponent's "flag."  The game
  can be played on any of thousands of different countryside maps -- the first
  thousand of which are selectable at the beginning of the game. All of these maps
  show roads, towns, hills, lakes, forests, orchards, and fields, and these
  geographic features impose restrictions and necessitate clever planning on the
  part of the player.  Completed in mid-1982, Mattel decided not to release the
  Game.

  game that resulted in the computer only choosing words starting with letters A-T

description:
  The object of Vectron is to construct an energy base, section by section. You
  add each section by moving your energy block in place and filling it with an
  energy blast. You must protect your energy block against Hungrees, G-spheres,
  splits, sweeps, and prizums who can destroy it. Shoot them down with energy
  blasts or neutralize them with special energy from an E-Pak. Don't run out of
  energy or you lose an energy block. There are three energy blocks per game. When
  they're gone, the game is over.

description:
  World Series Major League Baseball is a baseball sports game that supports both
  ECS and Intellivoice (for play by play announcements). The game is based on real
  baseball player statistics (even though the names had been changed to fictional
  ones before the release) and offers baseball games using multiple cameras
  (including in-game split-screen), showing the game in a 3D display rather than
  side-scrolling fashion.
