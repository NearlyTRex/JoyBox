developer: Vlambeer
publisher: Vlambeer
genre: Action
description:
  Nuclear Throne is an action roguelike game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland
  filled with mutants. The game was initially started as Wasteland Kings, a
  prototype created for the 2013 Mojam game jam. The developers then started work
  on a full version and took it to Steam's Early Access. Typical for the genre the
  game is meant to be played in multiple runs, with randomized environments, and
  weapon and monster placement for each session. It consists of several levels
  played in succession, each with a different theme, until the character gets a
  shot to claim the nuclear throne and become the new king. Many levels contain
  bosses with a brief introduction.
  .
  There is permadeath and up to twelve different playable characters can be
  unlocked, representing different playing styles. Next to the basic attack each
  character has a unique secondary action such as a roll or forming a shield,
  along with a general perk. The game is played as a twin-stick shooter where both
  movement and firing in any direction can be independently combined. Levels are
  short and always consist of a single, scrolling room. When all enemies are
  defeated a vortex appears that sucks the character into the next level. Levels
  contain random chests with weapons such as a revolver, machinegun, smart gun,
  minigun, shotgun, rifles, an incinerator, sluggers, bows, grenade launchers and
  bazookas, but also melee weapons such as a wrench or a screwdriver. Ranged
  weapons usually have a limited amount of ammo and require ammo pick-ups to keep
  using them. Up to two weapons can be carried and they can be swapped when a new
  one is encountered.
  .
  Enemies leave behind radioactive fragments known as rads. These can also be
  found as pick-ups. They fill a meter in the top left corner and when a
  sufficient amount has been collected the character levels up and a mutation is
  offered after completing a level. Mutations are perks permanent for that run and
  include a larger bullet capacity, less damage, more health, better range, better
  movement speed, slower enemy bullets, increased drops etc. The game supports
  cooperative offline games for up to two players. Next to the main game there are
  daily and weekly runs.

game: Witness, The (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation Network - PlayStation 4/Witness, The (USA)/Witness, The (USA).json
developer: Jonathan Blow
publisher: Thekla, Inc
genre: Puzzle
description:
  The Witness is an upcoming 3D puzzle video game created by Jonathan Blow, and in
  development by Thekla, Inc. The Witness is set for release on January 26, 2016,
  for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows, and for iOS on a later date.
  .
  Inspired by Myst, The Witness has the player explore an open world island filled
  with a number of natural and man-made structures. The player progresses by
  solving puzzles which are based on interactions with mazes presented on panels
  around the island, though the rules and outcomes of solving the individual mazes
  are part of the puzzles that the player will have to come to learn themselves
  through both visual clues around the island and through audio logs that the
  player can find. Blow aimed to include as little instruction as possible,
  wanting to have players come to understand the rules of these puzzles for
  themselves and coming to moments of realization while exploring the island. The
  final game will have about 650 total puzzles to be solved, though the player is
  not required to solve them all to finish the game.
  .
  Though originally announced in 2009, The Witness has had a lengthy development
  period. Blow started work on the title in 2008 after a short break from
  releasing Braid. The financial success of Braid allowed him to hire a larger
  team to develop the title and maintain his vision of what the final game would
  be without making any sacrifices. This led to a protracted development period,
  extending the game's release from 2011 to 2016, spanning a console generation.
  Original plans for release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were abandoned
  because the game's engine became too demanding, and Blow opted to develop the
  console version for the PlayStation 4 as Sony was more open towards independent
  developers.
