description:
  In the wake of the now defunct Navis's failed attempt to control recovered
  ancient weapons technology, the world has been left in tatters. Looking to
  consolidate power, the Corporations (Crest, Mirage, and Kisaragi) have merged
  into one super-corporation known as "The Alliance". Fed up with corporate rule
  and oppression, and seeing a newfound threat in The Alliance, a Raven known as
  Jack-O (an important but minor character from Armored Core: Nexus) forms an
  organization of Ravens known as "Vertex" from the ashes of the fallen Raven's
  Ark. After rallying a sizable force of fellow Ravens to his cause, Jack-O
  declares that he will launch an all-out war on the Alliance in 24 hours. Leading
  the opposing force, a Raven named Evangel has rallied just as many Ravens to the
  Alliance and is preparing to fight Jack-O head on. Making matters all the more
  complicated, many Ravens have turned into independent warlords, setting out on
  their own after the collapse of Raven's Ark.
  .
  To finish this volatile situation: you. You are approached by both sides seeking
  your cooperation. Will you side with the Corporations, or assist Vertex in
  causing their downfall? You have a choice to make, Raven.

description:
  In the year 2032, aliens have invaded Earth. Humanity bands together and fights
  back valiantly, but they are simply no match for the invading force, and their
  numbers steadily dwindle as fighting continues. At the brink of extinction after
  years of war, one last hope for humanity appears: Black Rock Shooter, a young
  girl who is also the most powerful biological weapon ever created. Working
  together with the last remnants of the human race, will she be able to repel the
  alien invasion and save the Earth?
  .
  Black Rock Shooter is an action-RPG based on the anime of the same name. It is
  in many ways a standard Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the eponymous
  Black Rock Shooter as she explores the battle-ravaged landscape, and enemies
  will approach her when they notice her. If they get close enough, the game will
  switch to battle mode, which is closer to a rail shooter rather than a standard
  turn-based battle system.
  .
  During battle, enemies will attack in real time. The player controls a cursor to
  aim Black Rock's rock cannon, and can shoot freely, as well as block, dodge, and
  use various items and special skills, but she cannot move freely around the
  battlefield. Certain actions will increase a heat gauge, which will only lower
  if she is allowed to rest. If the gauge gets too high, she will become
  temporarily unable to attack.
  .
  The game is divided into stages, each of which contains a number of missions and
  optional objectives. The stage ends when these missions are cleared. Optional
  objectives in each stage will reward the player with additional abilities and
  unlockable bonuses such as weapons, costumes, and concept art. Completed stages
  can be returned to in order to complete additional objectives.

  A gory, disturbing and uncomfortably exhilarating tale of mystery, fear and
  survival, in the tradition of the greatest Japanese horror classics!\n
  Join eight students and one teacher as they inadvertently invoke a powerful
  curse and find themselves wandering the haunted halls of Heavenly Host -- a
  constantly shifting echo of a tragedy-stricken elementary school that should
  have been torn down decades ago. With vengeful spirits lurking around every
  corner and an omnipresent pressure in the air threatening to break what's left
  of their sanity, they must race against their own impending dooms to solve the
  mystery of where and when they are, cataloguing the rotting corpses of their own
  unsuccessful predecessors all the while.\n
  Featuring retro-styled 2D visuals, agonizingly detailed art stills, binaural 3D
  audio with original Japanese voices, over two dozen endings and some truly
  twisted depictions of death, this story-driven horror adventure is the perfect
  nightmare fuel.

  Midnight Carnival is a spin off of the LocoRoco games, and forms a sequel to
  LocoRoco 2 and was released as a halloween special.
  .
  LocoRoco BuiBui, a red, sinister version of MuiMui, pulls on a nearby star which
  opens a trapdoor over a chute and into a cannon which sends LocoRoco into the
  titular Midnight Carnival that was designed by BuiBui as a secret base, and also
  gives LocoRoco the new "boing" power. It is now up to you to get out.
  .
  Gameplay is unchanged from previous LocoRoco games, you still have to roll along
  by tilting and bouncing your way over walls and climbing up walls. Each stage of
  the game tracks both your score and time progress. You can now dress up your
  LocoRoco.
  .
  Multiplayer comes in the form of four player ad-hoc games, which can be played
  over any of the single player levels.

game: Piyotama (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation Network - PlayStation Portable/Piyotama (USA)/Piyotama (USA).json
developer: SCE Japan Studio
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
genre: Puzzle
description:
  Piyotama is a puzzle game where the goal is to manipulate colored eggs and line
  up four or more in a row to "hatch" them. The eggs can only be manipulated when
  outside of the "nest" (the play area), which is accomplished by sliding the
  selected row of eggs to the left or right using the dpad. The order of the three
  eggs pushed out of the nest can be cycled left or right using the X and O
  buttons, respectively. The current row can be changed with the up and down
  directions on the dpad allowing them to be re-inserted on a different row to
  form lines of matching eggs.
  .
  Once a line of four eggs is formed a "hatch" is begun, giving the player a short
  time to create more lines of eggs to form a combo to score more points before
  the eggs hatch. When the "hatch" timer is up any eggs that formed part of a line
  will hatch and the little Piyos will fly off to collect on either side of the
  screen. An egg will hatch even if it is no longer part of a line of matching
  eggs, so long as it is not being held outside of the nest. The remaining eggs
  will fall to fill in the gaps. When enough points are scored the player's level
  increases.
  .
  An additional dimension is added to the controls by the use of the Sixaxis
  controller's motion-sensing abilities. By shaking the Sixaxis from side-to-side
  the eggs can be shaken to fall into gaps. Shaking the controller up-and-down
  will cause the eggs to jump about offering limited control in re-ordering the
  eggs beyond manipulating them three-at-a-time beyond the nest. If a hatch has
  started, shaking the controller will cause the eggs to hatch immediately. The
  maneuver can be particularly useful in the battle mode when the eggs are getting
  close to filling the nest, which would result in the end of the game.

developer: FluffyLogic
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
genre: Strategy
description:
  Savage Moon: The Hera Campaign, named with reference to the Aegophagus: the goat
  eating aspect of the Greek goddess. This huge gathering of Imoons, the Hera
  Cluster, drifted into human space a few months ago. Preliminary intelligence
  suggests that it consists of 20 Imoons populated by a rich variety of
  Insectocyte forms, some of which we have encountered before and some of which
  are new. The human military forces have advanced too with new technologies being
  available for the Hera Campaign. Pride of place goes to the Sniper Tower - a
  deadly new combat tower that seeks prey that poses the biggest threat within
  range. We have also separated the blocking towers from the rest of the
  tower-tech to give the player both drop-pods (that land a new combat or support
  tower) and block-pods (that land a blocking tower). And finally, in addition,
  you now play as the Supreme Commander of the entire armada. The player controls
  events for the whole campaign as well as each individual Imoon mission; choosing
  which Imoon to concentrate your resources on via the new Tactical Layer
  interface.
