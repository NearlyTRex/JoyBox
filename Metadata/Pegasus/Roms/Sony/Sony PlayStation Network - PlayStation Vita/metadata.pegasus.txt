  Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight is an action role-playing
  video game developed by Artdink and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment for
  the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and Microsoft Windows. It is based on the
  Accel World and Sword Art Online light novel series.
  .
  Accel World vs. Sword Art Online: Millennium Twilight is a team-based game (with
  all voiced dialogue in Japanese with English subtitles), where any of the three
  members can be switched at any time, each with their own attacks and abilities.
  To make a progress in the game's story mode, there are numerous main quests to
  complete. There are also side quests that are not necessary but will make
  playing the game much easier, thanks to the rewards and additional experience.
  Inspired by Sword Art Online: Lost Song, combat consists of melee (Accel World
  characters), learning skills, and occasional flying for aerial combat (Sword Art
  Online characters). All battles take place in an open environment the moment a
  contact is made with enemies. There is a hub called the Floating City of Ryne,
  which contains shops that allow for improving characters.

developer: Square Enix
publisher: Square Enix
genre: Action;Role-Playing
description:
  It is a 3D remake of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, the first
  game in the Mana series. The player takes the role of a young hero who, together
  with a heroine, tries to stop the Dark Lord of Glaive from destroying the Tree
  of Mana. The gameplay focuses on combat with monsters or other enemies, and is
  seen from a top-down perspective. The player traverses the game world, which is
  divided into several areas, and makes their way through dungeons. While fighting
  monster characters, a gauge is shown on the screen filling up over time and
  resetting when the player gets hit or attacks; by waiting to attack until the
  gauge is full, the player can use a stronger attack. The player is accompanied
  by various non-player characters, who each have different skills the player can
  use, and who help them defeat enemies.

genre: Adventure
description:
  Based on various legends of Mexican folklore, Grim Fandango is packed to the
  hilt with dancing skeletons, crime, romance, and much more. You play Manny
  Calavera, a mid-level worker at the Department of Death (the DOD) who's trying
  to work off his sins in life so that he can get to his final reward. As a
  reaper, Manny frees incoming souls from their shrouds, finds out what kind of
  underworld travel packages their goodness in life has earned them, and then
  sends them on their way. Unfortunately, business hasn't been very good for Manny
  of late. As the game begins, Calavera is told that he must sell a premium travel
  package to a soul or lose his job. In his search, Manny uncovers a hideous plot,
  a beautiful woman, and a crew of loyal friends (not necessarily in that order).
  Based on the acclaimed 1998 classic, this remake of Tim Schafer's original
  adventure title employs the stunning technology used to bring Broken Age to life
  for a fresh new way to experience Grim Fandango.

  enemy-controlled planets. Almost every weapon or tool accessible to players can
  hurt their teammates, making discipline and coordination paramount.

  Rainbow Moon is a Strategy-RPG from the makers of the hit Soldner-X franchise.
  Cursed by his long-time enemy, Baldren founds himself warped to Rainbow Moon.
  And to make things worse, Baldren isn't only stranded in an unknown place – he
  has also opened a dimensional gate, out of which troops of monsters are
  crawling, turning this once peaceful planet into a real hell.
  .
  The residents of Rainbow Moon who have found themselves in this sudden and
  unpleasant situation react suspiciously and even nastily, which certainly
  doesn't make things any easier for our brave hero. There's only one thing for
  Baldren to do: he has to seal the gate and warp himself back to his home planet.
  This is easier said than done, since the gate can only be sealed by a
  dimensional gate staff and no such object is available anywhere on Rainbow Moon.
  However Baldren knows that he can create one if he finds the right materials. He
  needs seven magical artifacts, said to be hidden deep inside Rainbow Moon's
  dungeons.
  .
  And this is where our quest begins ...

genre: Platform
description:
  Run Sackboy! Run! is an endless runner platform game featuring the lead
  character from the LittleBigPlanet series. When starting out we find Sackboy
  being chased by the Negativitron and it's up to the player to help him out so
  that he is not caught. Like in other games of its kind all forward movement is
  automatic and all the player has to do is tap the screen at the right time to
  make Sackboy jump. Jumping is needed to avoid obstacles and enemies as well as
  collecting bubbles and other items that can be found. Colliding with an obstacle
  like spikes or an enemy and the game ends, however enemies are knocked out if
  jumped onto. What also needs to be avoided is the pink goo which slows down
  Sackboy and allows the Negativitron to catch up. To escape it the player has to
  swipe across the screen to gain speed.
  .
  The game is free-to-play and the bubbles are the main currency used in the game.
  These are collected in the game but can also be acquired with real money. In the
  game's shop bubbles can be used to acquire costumes and power-up upgrades as
  well as lucky chests with random content. Like in many other free-to-play games
  there are boosts that can be activated before a game and also these cost
  bubbles. Another way to spend bubbles is to skip mission challenges. Missions
  are done by clearing specific objectives and by doing them the player can level
  up. By levelling up the player's score multiplier increases. Another object that
  the player can collect in the game as well as acquire with real money are the
  save-me-hearts. These can be used at the game over screen to revive Sackboy and
  allows the player to continue playing without losing his score.
  .
  Some power-ups can be found around the stages and they are automatically
  activated when picked up. This includes a magnet that allows Sackboy to collect
  bubbles at a a greater range and the jetpack which allows him to fly. They are
  active for a limited amount of time but by spending bubbles on upgrades this
  time can be extended. Other objects that can be collected are stickers. Once all
  stickers of a certain theme have been collected the player is awarded with a
  special prize. There are also some stickers that unlock content in other
  LittleBigPlanet games.
