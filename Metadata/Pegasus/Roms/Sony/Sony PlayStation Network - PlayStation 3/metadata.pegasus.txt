developer: Lexis Numerique
publisher: Lexis Numerique
genre: Action;Horror
description:
  Amy is a survival horror game where the player controls the woman Lana as she
  attempts to escort the 8-year old autistic girl Amy out of a city overrun with
  creatures and military. At the start of the game they are together in a train as
  Lana escorts her to a hospital after she is busted out of a shady research
  facility. The train suddenly derails and they end up in a dark and hostile
  environment. The game is played from a third-person perspective and the main
  goal is to make sure Lana keeps Amy out of harm's way. The creatures send out an
  infection, but Amy has an immunizing aura that prevents Lana from being infected
  as long as she keeps close. Therefore she walks around holding the girl's hand
  most of the game and they often need to sneak past hazards together. Lana is
  however also able to take out enemies with melee combat mechanics using sticks
  and crowbars, but in many situations that is not an option due to the number of
  opponents. Weapons also degrade over time. When Lana lets go of Amy, the
  infection gradually sets in and it causes the contamination sensor on her back
  to turn from green to yellow and red. It turns her skin pale and renders her
  vision hazy, but at certain points in the game it is necessary to sneak past
  creatures who then think she is one of their own.
  .
  As Amy's survival is vital for Lana, in many locations she is able to make her
  hide in closets or other spots when danger is lurking. The options to hide
  appear automatically when a viable location is nearby. Lana can also hide
  together with the girl or just by herself. All other control over Amy is also
  indirect. Lana can ask her to stay in a fixed place, call her to come over, make
  her turn on a lamp, or ask her to interact with an object in the environment.
  Amy has to hack into computers, crawl through small grates to access rooms,
  stand on elevators, and push buttons. There are also locks that can only be
  opened by collecting a specific DNA sample. These interactions are used
  extensively for environment-based puzzles. Later in the game Amy gets access to
  two psychic powers she can call upon; sending out a bubble that knocks down an
  opponent and a field that silences everything inside. These are activated by
  having Amy draw a glyph at specific locations around levels. The game consists
  of six chapters and saving is done automatically through checkpoints.

developer: Access Games
publisher: Ignition Entertainment
genre: Action;Horror
description:
  Deadly Premonition is an open world, survival horror video game developed by
  Access Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In 2010, the Xbox 360 version was
  published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in
  Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe, while the PlayStation 3 version was
  simultaneously released only in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment. A director's
  cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by
  Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of
  Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York
  Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is
  similar to a series of murders across the United States.
  .
  Deadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video
  game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after
  its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues.
  .
  The game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy
  horror theme to the survival horror genre. It is also notable for implementing a
  free-roaming storyline within an open game world where all the characters have
  their own schedules.
  .
  It has become known for its "headline making strangeness" and is considered one
  of the most critically polarising games of all-time (holding the Guinness World
  Record for most critically polarizing survival horror game), receiving both
  extremely negative and extremely positive reviews and is seen by some as an
  example of games as art.

description:
  The pioneers that brought you the award-winning PlayStation Network title flOw
  are back with another concept that challenges traditional gaming conventions.
  Flower expands the team's tradition of delivering simple gameplay, accessible
  controls and a medium to explore emotional chords uncommon in video games. In
  Flower, the surrounding environment, most often pushed to the background in
  games, is pulled to the forefront and becomes the primary "character." The
  player fades from an external and stressful world in the opening of this fresh
  and genuine game only for PS3, and journeys through beautifully vivid
  landscapes, changing the his surroundings and exploring nature along the way.
  .
  Playing as the wind, the player guides and grows a swarm of pedals by
  interacting with other flowers and the surrounding environment. The goals and
  journey in each level vary, but all involve flight, exploration and interaction
  with the level. Using simple SIXAXIS wireless controls, the player guides the
  lead petal and accumulates a swarm of flower petals as he moves at his own pace
  within the environment, causing the on-screen world to change. Flower's gameplay
  offers different experiences, pacing and rhythm to all players. Along the way,
  the environment will pose challenges to the player's progress.
  .
  Both pastoral and at times chaotic, Flower is a visual, audio and interactive
  escape on PS3.

  Hydrophobia was met with a mixed reception, with an aggregate score of 59/100 on

  In Ratchet: Deadlocked, Ratchet and Clank are captured and forced to compete on
  an underground reality combat sport show. The show, which features abducted
  heroes fighting for their lives against a gruesome gang of deadly Exterminators,
  is run by a deranged media mogul named Gleeman Vox, who intends to use Ratchet
  and Clank as his next contestants. It doesn't take Vox long to realize that
  Ratchet is the most promising contestant the show has ever seen. Vox subjects
  our hero to a series of deadly battles and elaborate games of death, much to the
  delight of the show's enormous audience. To keep himself and his friends alive,
  Ratchet has no choice but to participate in the games and keep driving up the
  show's ratings with spectacular victories -- at least until our heroes can
  figure out a way to break free from Vox's control, the explosive Deadlock collar
  fastened to his neck, and bring the mighty Vox Network crashing down. Ratchet:
  Deadlocked features non-linear gameplay, allowing players greater freedom to
  choose their missions. In addition, all single-player levels will be available
  for multiplayer use. With much of the combat taking place in battlefields and
  arenas, gameplay will be more sports-oriented and will include announcer
  commentary. Featuring a new mission-structure approach, players will be rewarded
  with a constant progression of items such as weapons, armor and health. Players
  can take advantage of the new co-op gameplay functionality available throughout
  the game by choosing either single-player or multiplayer story mode. In
  addition, squad-based gameplay will enable players to demolish the competition
  by commandeering their allied combat bots through critical and strategic
  battles.

game: Rush'N Attack - Ex-Patriot (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation Network - PlayStation 3/Rush'N Attack - Ex-Patriot (USA)/Rush'N Attack - Ex-Patriot (USA).json
developer: Vatra Games
publisher: Konami Digital Entertainment
genre: Action;Platform
description:
  Rush'n Attack: Ex-Patriot is inspired by many of the action gameplay elements
  from the original Rush'n Attack. The game is played from a 2.5D perspective,
  with players being able to move horizontally and vertically. The game has
  several new features over its predecessor such as non-linear levels,
  stealth-based combat, attack combos and usable equipment such as gas masks and
  night vision goggles. Associate Producer James Wong stated in an interview that
  the original game was "wave after wave of enemies" and that the development team
  sought to "go a little deeper" while retaining the "pick up and play nature of
  the original game." The game spans three large levels that are traversed both
  horizontally and vertically.
  .
  The player character is initially armed only with a knife, but can pick up other
  temporary-use weaponry such as grenades, rifles and rocket launchers. The game
  sometimes requires the player character to use stealth to avoid enemy units or
  security cameras. Triggering any alarm will result in nearby enemies rushing to
  the source of the alarm trigger. Alarms can by triggered by making too much
  noise or by being noticed by one of the security cameras within the game's
  setting. In a departure from Rush'n Attack, the player character is given a
  health bar instead of the original one hit death.
  .
  shank combos are the primary way in which players can earn points.The combat
  system is based on systema, a Russian martial art. As the character progresses
  new combos can be unlocked. Chaining combos together will result in the player
  gaining more points earned. The character can also dispatch enemies using
  stealth tactics. Generally stealth kills reward the player with a higher score.
  Stealth kills can be performed by hiding in dark areas or by entering dark
  doorways, then exiting for the kill as an enemy passes.

  Waylon Smithers has just stolen a diamond from Springfield Jewelers for Mr.
  Burns. While trying to make a getaway, he crashes into Homer, which knocks the
  diamond out of his hand. Maggie catches it in her mouth, prompting Smithers to

  tons of henchmen, who want to prevent the family getting their daughter back.
  .
  The Simpsons is basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up featuring the characters
  from The Simpsons TV show. The player can choose to play as each of the four
  Simpson characters. Homer, who punches and kicks; Marge, who swings her vacuum

  whip. Other weapons such as hammers and bowling balls are also available to use.
  The game's levels are Downtown Springfield, Krustyland, Springfield Discount
  Cemetery, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Gorge, Dreamland, the Channel 6 studio, and
  the Power Plant. Each level ends with a boss whose speed and strength will
  increase after taking a certain amount of damage. End level bosses are the
  wrestler Professor Werner von Brawn, a hot air balloon shaped like Krusty the
  Clown, a pair of bouncers, a drunk at Moe's Tavern, a henchman in a bear suit,
  an imaginary, gigantic bowling ball, and a martial arts sensei dressed like a
  kabuki actor. There's also the showdown finale against Smithers and Mr. Burns in
  a robotic outfit.
  .
  Between levels, the player can compete against the other characters in two
  mini-games to be first to complete a task (inflating a balloon and waking up
  their character).

description:
  Sonic the Hedgehog CD (ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグCD Sonikku za Hejjihoggu Shī Dī?), or Sonic
  CD (ソニックCD Sonikku Shī Dī?), is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team
  and published by Sega originally for the Sega/Mega-CD in 1993. It is the first
  game in the Sonic series to make use of the CD-ROM format, featuring high
  quality audio and full motion video. Development began in Japan around the same
  time as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in the United States. Originally, the games had
  many similarities, but over time became vastly different projects.[3]
  .
  The story of Sonic CD follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he utilizes time travel to
  save Amy Rose and Little Planet from Doctor Eggman and Metal Sonic. The game
  features the debut appearances of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, both of whom have
  gone on to become recurring characters in the Sonic series. Time travel is a key
  aspect to both the story and gameplay, with nearly every stage containing four
  different variations (one for each time period) featuring alternate stage
  layouts, music, and graphics.
  .
  Sonic CD received critical acclaim, being considered both one of the best
  platform and Sega/Mega-CD games of all-time.[4][5][6] It was ported to Microsoft
  Windows 9x as part of the Sega PC brand in 1996, and to both the PlayStation 2
  and GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005. An enhanced port of
  the game was also released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, iOS,
  Android, Windows, Windows Phone, and Ouya.

developer: Sega AM2
publisher: Sega
genre: Action;Fighting;3D
description:
  Sonic Championship is a 3D fighting game, featuring characters from the Sonic
  the Hedgehog franchise. The background story is that Doctor Eggman built the
  Death Egg II, a new version of his facility that appeared in previous games.
  Stopping him requires Chaos Emeralds, and various individuals including heroes
  like Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles "Tails" Prower participate in a fighting
  tournament to gather them. In total there are eight playable characters (nine in
  later console releases) and two bosses (Metal Sonic and Doctor Eggman).
  .
  Gameplay is mostly typical for a versus fighter, it is a one-on-one fight on a
  best two out of three basis. Players use jumps, punches, kicks and special
  weapons. Bean the Dynamite for example, a duck-like character who makes his
  debut in the Sonic universe, uses bombs. Blocking is done by making use of a
  limited supply of barriers. The whole action is illustrated in a comical fashion
  though, like one would expect from a Sonic game. A round is won when a player
  managed to deplete an opponent's health, unless the timer runs out, in which
  case the character with the most energy left is the winner. Environments are 3D
  closed arenas, but the gameplay is mostly 2D, allowing limited sidestep
  maneuvers.

  Goblin King and his minions, as well as the tale of two sisters who are also
  princesses.
  .
  Just like in the first game players can freely switch between the three
  characters to tackle the environment-based challenges. The knight is strong and
  most suited for close combat, the thief is agile and has long-ranged attacks,
  and the wizard is a feeble character that uses magic to manipulate items. Many
  of the original abilities are still present. The wizard creates boxes and planks
  as temporary platforms, the thief uses grapple to cross large gaps, and the
  knight is able to deflect projectiles with his shield. New abilities are
  unlocked through a skill tree shared by the characters, and some of the new
  options allow the wizard to chuck opponents around or for the thief to upgrade
  her arrows with new enhancements. Skill points are earned by locating vials.
  There is no longer an inventory with items gathered from treasure chests for
  additional upgrades. Instead the chests yield poetry that reveal bits of the
  story.
  .
  The game can be played cooperatively with three players each controlling a
  character simultaneously. This can be done both offline and, new for this
  sequel, online. When a character dies, it can be revived at the next checkpoint.
  There are two new gameplay modes that are available right away. There is Game+
  that allows players to go through the game again with their fully upgraded
  characters from the start. The second one is called Unlimited Character Mode and
  it allows players to assemble a party of any combination of characters, for
  instance using just three thieves. The game design always offers multiple
  approaches to over the challenges.

description:
  Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and
  published by Apogee Software. Originally released on May 5, 1992, for the PC
  operating system DOS, the game was inspired by the 1980s Muse Software video
  games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. A promotional version of
  Wolfenstein 3D was released as shareware, which permitted it to be copied
  widely. The game was later ported to a wide range of computer systems and video
  game consoles.
  .
  The shareware release contains one episode consisting of ten levels. The
  commercial release consists of three episodes, which include the shareware
  episode and two subsequent episodes. Later releases included a three-episode
  mission pack titled The Nocturnal Missions. The player assumes the role of a
  World War II Allied spy William "B.J." Blazkowicz, who is trying to escape from
  Castle Wolfenstein, a Nazi German prison. After the initial escape episode,
  Blazkowicz carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis.
  .
  Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as
  having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic
  run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter games.
