game: Alien Resurrection (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Alien Resurrection (USA)/Alien Resurrection (USA).json
developer: Argonaut Games
publisher: Fox Interactive
genre: Shooter
description:
  Two hundred years after the events of AlienÂ³, Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is cloned
  by military scientists interested in the Alien Queen she had become a host for.
  Like the "Company" from the earlier films, the military intends to use the Queen
  to breed a force of bio-weapons. But then something goes wrong; the Aliens they
  are studying manage to escape, and swarm throughout the science ship. It's up to
  four stranded heroes - Ripley, Call, DiStephano and Christie - to wipe out the
  Aliens, and return the ship safely to Earth.
  .
  Gameplay is standard FPS action, with limited ammo and plenty of hazards to
  detour around or find the switch to deactivate. The player switches between the
  four main characters at each level change, each with a slightly different set of
  abilities (Call has a motion tracker, Christie has his twin pistols from the
  film). Levels are based around keeping the Auriga running, and making their way
  through the ship to escape.

  action star Bruce Willis. And darn it if he isn't the world's only hope; he has

  third-person 3D viewpoint, Kincaid can maneuver in a 360-degree rotational
  manner; this is very important as the action takes place on all sides.

  Hunter that becomes tangled in the plot and eventually joins the battle against

  In the presumably distant future, the vast majority of Earth's population is
  wiped out by a cataclysmic war known as the Great Destruction. The harsh

  fifty years, during which time corporations come to power. The two largest
  corporations, Chrome and Murakumo Millennium, constantly battle each other for
  supremacy, causing significant strife among the populace. However, the
  competition provides endless opportunities for the Ravens, mercenaries who exist
  independently of the corporations. You, the protagonist, pilot an armored core

developer: Candle Light Studios

genre: Action
description:
  Assault: Retribution supplies you with some of the best firepower modern
  technology can provide, as well as various customization options to ensure
  "better living through quick death disbursement." Washington utilizes a barrage
  of destructive weaponry such as the P-420 Multi-Phase Pulse Rifle and the aptly
  named Cutter; Doyle uses a variety of Homing Missiles, Beam Lasers, and the D-16
  Magnetic Bolt Accelerator. There's also a plethora of pickups including weapon
  upgrades, health, ammunition recharges, smart bombs, extra lives, and shields.
  Save points within each level let you resume the killing when it is most
  convenient for you. And (rare as of 1999), there is a two-player cooperative
  mode in case you feel that one ultimate killing machine just isn't enough.
  .
  Assault: Retribution is a 3D platform shooting game that takes place across
  seven futuristic levels, includes two playable characters with alternate routes,
  analog control, and memory card support. You can't spell action, adrenaline or

game: Battle Arena Toshinden (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Battle Arena Toshinden (USA)/Battle Arena Toshinden (USA).json
developer: Tamsoft
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
genre: Fighting
description:
  In Battle Arena Toshinden eight world renown weapon fighters have been invited
  to a mysterious tournament. It is one of the first one-on-one beat-em-ups to
  feature the ability to sidestep a full 360 degrees around the opponent allowing
  one to strike from any angle. Aside from the 3d movement, Toshinden's game play
  can be considered similar to Street Fighter, but in 3d and with a little less
  depth to the moves.
  .
  Two versions of Toshinden were released; for the Sony PlayStation and later a
  lesser known version for DOS PC's. However the PC version is not a straight port
  of the PlayStation version and plays and looks notably different despite sharing
  the same characters, attacks and controls.
  .
  The U.S and E.U Playstation versions of Toshinden feature redone voices in
  English and redone music using different instruments.
  .
  The lyrics on Sofia's stage music in the Japanese version, which were actually
  in English, were removed in the process, likely due to their suggestive nature.
  .
  Sofia's and Ellis' voices in the English translation are also notably adjusted,
  for presumably the same reason; while the other characters English voices
  generally match the tones of the original Japanese voice actors, Sofia is far
  less suggestive sounding, while Ellis sounds notably older.
  .
  The later Dos version of Toshinden however, uses the same audio as the Japanese
  Playstation version in all regions, albeit recorded at a considerably lower
  quality than they were on Playstation.

description:
  150 years ago, the legendary warrior known as the Brave Fencer Musashi saved the
  kingdom of Allucaneet from the evil Wizard of Darkness. Now, his spirit is
  reincarnated in a young, rather short-tempered boy. Fillet, the princess of
  Allucaneet, summons the reluctant hero to the palace and gives him the powerful
  sword Fusion, which he needs to defeat the evil Thirstquencher Empire. It soon
  turns out that the Empire is after another legendary sword, Lumina, so Musashi's
  first task is to get it before the bad guys do!..
  .
  Brave Fencer Musashi is an action game with strong RPG elements. Controlling
  Musashi, the player explores the pre-rendered backgrounds from third person view
  (similarly to Final Fantasy VII), visiting towns, talking to NPCs, etc. There is
  a day/night cycle in the game, which is manifested in the schedules of NPCs
  and/or monsters, as well as Musashi's fatigue level, which increases if he
  doesn't sleep enough. Musashi uses the two swords, Fusion and Lumina, to fight
  his enemies. The two swords have different properties: while Fusion behaves more
  or less like a traditional melee weapon, Lumina needs to be imbued with various
  elemental items in order to unleash powerful attacks.

  the playfield.

  The Breakout world of 2000 is an island filled with bizarre creatures in the

game: Breath of Fire IV (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Breath of Fire IV (USA)/Breath of Fire IV (USA).json
developer: Capcom
publisher: Capcom
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Nina, the princess of Wyndia, and Cray, chieftain of the cat-like Woren tribe,
  are searching for Cray's relatives who disappeared under mysterious
  circumstances during a diplomatic mission. Flying through the sky on their
  sandflier, Nina and Cray are attacked by a worm shaped dragon. With their
  vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked
  young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very
  same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events
  taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy. Meanwhile, the ancient Emperor
  Fou Lu awakens from his slumber in his tomb. His plan is to return to the world
  of human, conquer it anew, and impose his iron rule on it...
  .
  This fourth installment of the Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional
  Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story
  progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the previous
  game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for
  "masters" living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series,
  has retained the series' trademark gameplay element: the ability to turn into a
  dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types,
  including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous
  installments as well.	After centuries of war, the two lands bordering an
  impenetrable swampland have finally reached an armistice. Mysteriously, the
  noble Princess Elena disappears somewhere near the war-ravaged front lines.
  Distraught, her sister Nina goes in search of the Princess alone and on her
  journey, meets a mysterious young warrior named Ryu. Their destinies soon
  entwine. The next chapter in the epic tale of magic and mystery now unfolds. The
  fate of what lies ahead rests in your control.

description:
  Broken Helix puts you in the boots of an armed marine of a special forces team.
  You are sent in to a military base which has been taken over by terrorists for
  unknown reasons.
  .
  The main character is voiced by Bruce Campbell, star of the Evil Dead movies.

  bomb. There is no visible time limit, but if you do not make it up to that floor
  in time, the bomb will go off, and you will die.
  .
  There are various objectives to complete, such as disarming bombs and finding
  certain items, but the game is mostly action/adventure, searching for keys to
  open doors.

description:
  Five years ago, Richter Belmont, the latest in the Belmont lineage and the one
  destined to be a Vampire Hunter, defeated Dracula in a brutal battle which

  is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters
  into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again.

  Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. The game
  is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths,
  although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage
  to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The
  hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes
  more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various
  accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons,
  shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary
  weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to
  advanced one-on-one fighting games.

  advance the game by controlling the protagonist Serge through the game's world,

  overworld map, much like Chrono Trigger's, depicting the landscape from a scaled
  down overhead view. Around the island world are villages, outdoor areas, and
  dungeons, through which the player moves in three dimensions. Locations such as
  cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in
  which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve
  puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Like Chrono Trigger, the game
  features no random encounters; enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie
  in wait to ambush the party

  Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, known in Japan as Clock Tower Ghost Head
  (ã¯ã­ãã¯ã¿ã¯ã¼ã´ã¼ã¹ãããã?), is a point-and-click adventure game created by Human
  Entertainment, published by Agetec, and released for the PlayStation in 1998. It
  is a spin-off to the Clock Tower series and has almost nothing to do with the
  previous games besides its gameplay.
  .
  Following its predecessors, the gameplay is more about hiding and solving
  puzzles, rather than fighting the player's pursuers. This degenerates as the
  plot advances, and the main character is eventually forced to use guns and other
  tools in several endgame action sequences.
  .
  Its interface consists of a point-and-click system similar to the one used by
  Sierra Entertainment games, such as the Gabriel Knight series. There is an
  inventory screen that appears if the user drags the pointer to the upper side of
  the screen. The game's engine looks similar to Clock Tower 2 (Clock Tower in
  North America), with a few minor alterations.

description:
  Because Capcom's Resident Evil single-handedly created the modern survival
  horror genre, the critically acclaimed adventure spawned countless sequels and
  clones. Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of
  those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a
  series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors.
  .
  As a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at
  the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located
  in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt
  at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes
  sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into
  murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a
  civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the
  mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple
  monstrosities.
  .
  Armed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply
  of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve
  weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located
  throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending
  machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access
  an e-mail program that furthers the storyline.
  .
  In Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based
  condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body,
  yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death.
  You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the
  casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve
  various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors.
  .
  Features:
  .
  * Rescue guests and turn them back into humans using an Anesthetic gun and white
  water\n
  * Take down enemies with a variety of weapons including pistols, shot guns,

game: Crusader - No Remorse (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Crusader - No Remorse (USA)/Crusader - No Remorse (USA).json
developer: Realtime Associates Inc.
publisher: Origin Systems
genre: Action;Adventure;Shooter
description:
  As No Remorse opens, a trio of Silencersâenigmatic super-soldiersâare returning
  from a botched mission in which they disobeyed an order to fire upon civilians
  who were (mistakenly) believed to be rebels. They are ambushed by a WEC mech,
  and two of the Silencers are killed. The remaining one, a nameless captain,
  (whom the player plays as), joins the Resistance, where, as a significant symbol
  of the WEC's military power and political philosophy, he meets with resentment,
  distrust and outright hatred. However, he uncomplainingly undertakes dangerous
  missions, often with substandard equipment, and his continued success gradually
  earns the respect of his fellow Resistance members.
  .
  The Captain eventually uncovers secret plans for a WEC space station, the
  Vigilance Platform, which can attack any location on Earth from space, meaning
  cities with a known Resistance presence can simply be annihilated at the leisure
  of the WEC. All such cities are threatened with orbital bombardment unless they
  surrender. Concurrently, the player's Resistance cell is betrayed from within,
  and almost all the non-player characters are killed. Despite these setbacks, the
  Captain infiltrates the Vigilance Platform and destroys it. The traitor is also
  on the station, guarding the lifepods, and challenges the Silencer to a duel
  over the access card for the last pod. As the Vigilance Platform is exploding,
  the Captain is contacted by Chairman Draygan, who swears vengeance against the
  Silencer.

developer: KCE Tokyo
publisher: Konami
genre: Music
description:
  One of the world's most influential games makes its way out of Japan for a
  home-based dance experience like no other. Using a big dance mat (sold
  separately), you'll step to the beat of the song playing, executing a specific
  set of moves to a tee. Your cues will come from the screen in the form of four
  columns of instructions that scroll upwards. Score points by nailing the timing
  of each step and getting the order of moves correct. The action will get faster
  and more furious as the game progresses, instructing you to pull off trickier
  combos in more limited time periods. As in the Japanese release of the game, a
  Diet mode shows you how many calories you're burning. To account for the steep
  learning curve, DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION even includes a Training mode to get you
  started. Packed with remixes of old songs and brand-new gems, the soundtrack
  boasts 27 danceable tunes. Though it's possible to play without the dance mat,
  working up a sweat is half the fun of this inventive game.
  .
  This is the first international release of the game, featuring a song list
  similar to the arcade title Dance Dance Revolution USA Mix, and should not be
  confused with the 1999 Japanese-only PlayStation release of the same name (a
  port of the very first Dance Dance Revolution arcade release).

  from Konami's all-time best Dance Mania tracks. Move it wild to slightly J-Pop
  and throw down fierce to some manic techno. And to get the best of it all, throw
  a party with a few rounds of 2-player Dance Dance dance-offs! Plus, with the
  special Dance Pad (available with the Dance Dance Revolution Dance Pad set), you
  can get your friends and neighbors on the floor and down on their feet just like

developer: Atlus

genre: Horror
description:
  The future Tokyo is a megapolis built on top of a huge system of underground
  tunnels and sewers. A rumor is heard that in this underground world hide the
  followers of a mysterious cult, known as the Dark Messiah. At the same time a
  symbiotic life form escapes from scientists and makes it's way into the sewer
  system. There it causes the crash of a subway train and starts devouring the
  passengers on board. A lone hero, along with a schoolgirl Naomi Sugiura are the
  only survivors of the crash.... and must flee from the creature in order to
  survive.
  .
  Hellnight is a survival horror game at heart, although it has no combat
  gameplay. Controlling the nameless hero, the player must travel through the
  underground and protect Naomi. There is only one monster in the whole game, the
  "creature" itself, which is invulnerable and cannot be killed. Instead players
  are constantly on the run from it, making sure it does not catch them. The game
  is divided into large maze-like levels, each one usually populated by the
  creature who keeps pursuing the player (although he does change form after each
  level). At certain points there will be companions who can attack the monster
  and temporarily stun him. There are also people to talk to in the underground
  world, items to pick up, and puzzles to solve.

developer: Vertex Zero
publisher: Sammy Entertaiment
genre: Action;Adventure
description:
  Dark Tales from the Lost Soul is a obscure Japanese horror game, Dark Tales
  allows the player to experience three separate stories.
  .
  It's an interesting little Choose Your Own Adventure title in which you go
  through three distinct stories, selecting different choices when prompted, and
  surviving the attempts of evil beings on your life. The game is divided into
  "DECIDE" moments (make a selection), "DECIDE/Dodge" (in which you must dodge
  attacks), "DECIDE/Shoot" (attempt to shoot at the enemy), as well as an
  additional series of dodging events and two 'mini-games'. There are also quick
  reflex events, in which you must press the indicated button quickly.
  .
  Naturally, there are multiple endings to be found depending on the decisions you
  make. There seem to be 'End Points' associated with the endings, but I don't
  know what significance these have, if any.
  .
  All of the game is within first-person perspective, and what is most interesting
  is that no people are ever pictured on screen. You can tell that there are
  people there, based on the sounds they make and their voices, but you cannot see
  them. Very odd.
  .
  The graphics are actually reminescent of the original Alone in the Dark... the
  rendering seems dead similar, and is just as pixely/edgy/whatnot. There is also
  a noted lack of 'detail' - the developers likely had to cut certain graphical
  details to keep the game running smoothly on the PlayStation. It seems to work
  with the lack of actual visible people in giving the title a sort of surreal
  edge.
  .
  There are FMVs: all of them feature a faceless audience with a wide variety of
  items on their tables... and a single host, the only human face we see
  throughout the entire title. A creepy, gaunt man, he introduces each of the
  tales and gives off some possibly cheesy yet very entertaining dialogue.

developer: Squaresoft
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
genre: Shooter
description:
  In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows
  larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the
  moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for
  either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win...
  except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as EinhÃ¤nders:
  flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.
  .
  On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 EinhÃ¤nders in a last attempt to turn
  the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to
  battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.
  .
  The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds
  and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German
  industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed
  with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of
  the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than
  the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.

  Fires, smoke, and other hazards await as Pete tries to save the day. Use of the
  fire extinguisher is unlimited although continues are limited in number. The
  game was released in Europe, Australia and Japan.

  The Firemen 2 tells the story of two courageous firemen who are named Pete Grey
  and Danny McClean. They're busy keeping New York City safe from rampaging fires.
  The game takes place on Christmas Eve. Guided by their correspondent back at the
  station, Winona, Pete and Danny must visit multiple areas across the city, and
  put a stop to a series of mysterious fires that have been popping up all over.
  .
  You (or you and a friend in 2 player mode) guide Pete and Danny in a traditional
  bird's eye view format. The game plays like a standard old-school 2D shooter
  game, like Commando or Contra. The only difference is, instead of guns, you're
  armed with hoses. And instead of seemingly endless military and/or alien drones,
  you battle the most malicious fire to ever walk the face of the earth.
  .
  The areas that our heroes explore include a wide variety of locations around New
  York City. These places include a theme park, a giant aquarium, a hotel, and
  even an animatronic dinosaur exhibit. In each level, you are given a mission.

genre: Shooter
description:
  Gaia Seed is a horizontally scrolling shooter from Techno Soleil. The game comes
  from the fabulous line of classically-styled Japanese shoot 'em ups, bursting at
  the seams with parallax scrolling, screen-filling bosses and other classic
  effects that you could count on from the games of this era. But the real beauty
  of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The game has tight control, precise bullet
  collision, and a simple powerup system, while the haunting soundtrack stands out
  for its techno/ambiance mood, adding to the subliminal nature of the work.

genre: Shooter
description:
  Galaga, the "slide-and-shoot" arcade classic from 1981, has been updated with
  nine new worlds, 3D graphics, futuristic backgrounds and more in GALAGA --
  Destination: Earth.
  .
  It is late in the 22nd century, and the insect-like Galaga are back. Humans have
  terraformed and colonized most habitable places in our solar system, but the
  Galaga have only one thing in mind: destruction. The Galaga are mutated nanites
  that were inadvertently created during the terraforming process. They are
  deadly, autonomous and great in number, and you must blast them into oblivion.
  In addition to shooting Galaga, you must perform various mission objectives,
  such as collecting life pods and activating water turbines.
  .
  Like in the original game, you begin this enhanced version of Galaga controlling
  a ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the playfield and fires
  upward at wave after wave of diving, swirling aliens that eventually fly into
  formation. However, unlike the original, this game, depending on what mission
  you are playing, features a number of other viewpoints, including over the
  shoulder, top down and side on. You can fire just two shots at a time, but you
  can gain the ability to have three shots onscreen at once.
  .
  Also like the original game, GALAGA -- Destination: Earth features challenge
  waves in which you blast streams of enemies for points while not having to worry
  about your own safety. And, of course, you can let a Galaga capture your ship,
  then shoot your ship's captor, letting the captured ship fall to you, enabling
  you to double your firepower. Similar to Gaplus, the sequel to classic Galaga,
  this game also lets you collect beam power-ups that enable you to capture
  enemies, place them by your side and use their weapons.

description:
  A young man named Rion wakes up in a hospital. He does not know who he is; he
  can hear a girl's voice in his mind, imploring him to save her. While trying to
  escape from the hospital, Rion is detained by guards, and discovers that he
  possesses devastating psychic powers. Trying to understand what has been done to
  him, Rion gradually uncovers the mystery behind the "G Project", a human
  experiment that involves unlocking the hidden potential of the human mind.
  .
  Galerians is a survival horror game in which the player navigates a 3D character
  model over pre-rendered backgrounds, using character-related controls similar to
  those implemented in Alone in the Dark. Items must be collected to unlock new
  areas and advance the story. Unlike in most other games of the type, the
  protagonist is unable to use weapons. Rion fully relies on his psychic powers to
  combat enemies. These powers must be replenished by regularly taking drugs. In
  addition, Rion has a special meter that throws him into uncontrollable rage when
  full.

developer: Midway
publisher: Midway
genre: Action
description:
  For those unfamiliar with the original Gauntlet and its various home versions,
  the action involved fighting enemies such as ghosts, demons and sorcerers
  spawned from square structures called monster generators. An overhead
  perspective allowed players the freedom to explore the maze-like levels while
  still being able to see everything around them.
  .
  The object of each stage was simply to destroy the monsters in your path as you
  searched for the exit leading to the next level. Gauntlet Legends takes this
  simple formula and adds a new story, distinct worlds and even boss characters to
  fight. Of course, there are still treasure and potions waiting to be found as
  well as various traps that could spell disaster for even the heartiest of
  warriors.
  .
  In order to help you survive the later levels (Gauntlet Legends consists of over
  30 stages), characters can earn experience points that will eventually translate
  into added strength, speed, armor and health. The story behind the game involves
  a jealous brother (Garm) of a noble wizard (Sumner) who decided to gather 13
  Rune Stones in order to raise a demon.
  .
  Once the stones were placed on the floor of Sumner's tower, a hideous monster
  named Skorn was awakened and promptly consumed its new "master." As one of four
  intrepid adventurers, your goal is to travel through the worlds making up the
  Gauntlet Legends universe to defeat the evil demon Skorne and his various
  followers (a rather unsavory lot of Grunts, Ankle Biters, Suiciders, Bomb
  Throwers and Death).
  .
  To help you fight the good fight, you'll be able to find food, special weapons
  and power icons that can all be stored in your inventory and used whenever your
  character needs them. Some of the weapons include a three-way shot, fire breath
  and super shot, while the power-ups include super speed, invisibility and
  Anti-Death Power (which allows you to steal health from the normally
  invulnerable Death).

description:
  In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying
  to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and
  behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.
  .
  The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each
  based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas
  (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a
  certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving
  over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the big points are
  made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission
  assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or
  carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score
  substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the
  next felony will gain even more points.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Grandia (Japanese: ã°ã©ã³ãã£ã¢ Gurandia?) is a role-playing video game developed by
  Game Arts originally for the Sega Saturn console as the first game in their
  Grandia series. Initially released in Japan in January 1997, the game was later
  ported to the PlayStation in June 1999, with an English version of the game
  appearing on the platform in North America in the following September by SCEA,
  and later in Europe in March 2001 by Ubisoft. The game was produced by much of
  the same staff who worked on the company's previous role-playing endeavor, the
  Lunar series, including producer Yoichi Miyagi and music composer Noriyuki
  Iwadare.
  .
  Since its release, Grandia has become notable for its combat mechanics which
  have been carried over to future games within the franchise, and has spawned two
  spin-off titles - Grandia: Digital Museum and Grandia: Parallel Trippers - both
  released exclusively in Japan. In celebration of the announcement of renewing
  development on Grandia Online, which acts as a prequel to Grandia, the game was
  re-released on Sony's PlayStation Network platform in Japan as a downloadable
  title in April 2009 and in North America on February 25, 2010. It was
  re-released in Europe on November 10, 2010.
  .
  The game is set in a fantasy world of emerging technology and exploration. A
  young boy named Justin inherits a magic stone that leads him on a journey around
  the world to uncover the mystery of a long-lost civilization. Along the way, he
  meets other adventurers who join him on his quest, which draws the attention of
  the militaristic Garlyle Forces who seek to uncover the secrets of the past as
  well. Grandia received a largely positive critical response during its original
  release, and was voted by readers of Japan's highly circulated Famitsu magazine
  as the 73rd greatest game of all time in a 2006 poll.

  receive an ominous message about a place called God's Tower. Taking care of Baby
  is just one of the many problems you'll face as you fight the forces of evil.

  the capacity to change how Baby reacts in battle depending on how you treat him
  throughout the game, and the inclusion of 70 Living Toys, non-player characters
  which you collect throughout the game. These toys have special abilities like
  ninja skills and healing, which can help you in battles.

  Gubble is a cute, colorful alien and he needs your help to get back to his home
  in this PlayStation game. It seems that creatures of Gubble's kind are
  particularly adept at loosening screws, nails, rivets, and other such fasteners.
  So adept, in fact, that Gubble has been kidnapped and sent to a dangerous planet
  to ply this skill. His captors have instructed him to unfasten the screws and
  bolts on a large enemy ship, promising to return him to his home if he is
  successful.
  .
  Success will take good puzzle-solving skills though (and perhaps a little luck),
  as the falling pieces from the unfastened ship could put a quick end to Gubble's
  efforts. Not to mention the enemy creatures, who would rather their high-tech

  Rapid Reload, known in Japan as Gunners Heaven, is a run and gun video game in
  the vein of Gunstar Heroes. It was among the first of its genre (or any genre
  for that matter) available for the Sony PlayStation, and although it has very
  few features, it became one of the most popular games of its time.
  .
  Story:\n
  Upon hearing the legend of the treasure known as the Valkiry, treasure hunters
  Axel Sonics and Ruka Hetfield embark on an adventurous quest to find the
  legendary stone. However, unknown to Axel and Ruka at the start, there is also a
  terrorist organization known as the Pumpkin Heads searching for the Valkiry,
  determined to use the stone for World Domination.
  .
  Can Axel and Ruka beat the Pumpkin Heads to the Valkiry and save the world from
  an Age of Darkness?
  .
  Gameplay:\n
  The player chooses to play as either Axel or Ruka, and with the chosen
  character, the player will fight his/her way through six levels, each one harder
  than the previous. With the exception of levels 3 and 5, each level contains two
  subbosses (Area Boss) and a final boss (Guardian). In level 3, there is one Area
  Boss and a Guardian, and in level 5, just a Guardian.
  .
  The game has often been criticized by fans for the near-impossibility of
  completing as Ruka, due to her weapons' disadvantages which make it impossible
  for Ruka to defend herself especially in levels 3 and 4.

file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Hoshigami - Ruining Blue Earth (USA)/Hoshigami - Ruining Blue Earth (USA).json
developer: MaxFive
publisher: Atlus
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  Utilizing a host of new gameplay elements, Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth expands
  upon the formula made popular by the cult classic Final Fantasy Tactics. The
  continent of Mardias serves as the game's primary world, and is divided into
  three kingdoms: Nightweld, the Valaimian Empire and Gerauld. The story begins as
  Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom. Lacking the
  military might to repel the invaders from multiple fronts, Fazz - a mercenary
  and the game's protagonist - is hired to defend the Tower of Wind. Needless to
  say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting
  Fazz.
  .
  As you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various
  battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of
  actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions
  performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have
  to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge
  appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at
  the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy. Wait too long
  however and the slider will return to the beginning.

  In Cold Blood requires players to use more brains than brawn in solving a case
  of international intrigue, puzzle-solving, clue gathering, and the unwinding of
  a tangled web of espionage, double-crosses and a sinister plot that might
  threaten the free world. The story unwinds in an unusual manner: At the start of
  the game, your character, Agent John Cord, has been captured by the enemy and is
  in the midst of a grueling interrogation. The scenes from the game come from his
  memories as he is undergoing this ordeal, with players taking on his previous
  adventures that lead him up to this point. It is a spy-thriller in the vein of
  James Bond, and as Cord remembers more, the overall story begins to make more
  sense.
  .
  Throughout In Cold Blood, players will have to search for hidden objects and
  talk to a whole host of characters, attempting at every turn to solve the
  puzzles that pop up in their way. But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing
  blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in
  high-octane gun battles against enemy agents. Occasionally, the player can
  outwit the enemies, but they'll often they'll have to fight it out in a duel to
  the death.

developer: Techno Soleil
publisher: Techno Soleil
genre: Action;Platform
description:
  The Rapid Angel (aka Kaisoku Tenshi - The Rapid Angel) comes from the same
  platformer fold that classics such as Valis, Makeruna Makendo and Ninja Warriors
  sproted from. Like those earlier offerings, the goal is to move across the
  screen and attack enemies and obstacles alike.
  .
  The biggest difference with other beatem up games is the 2 player mode in which
  the 2nd player takes the role of the angel and can help the first player
  character during the game.
  .
  CHARACTERS:\n
  3 heroines to choose from: Natsumi, Ayane and Haruna. Each of these girls fights
  in her own personal style. The way they fight and defend themselves vary
  immensely and give the game 3 completely different ways to be played.
  .
  1 - Natsumi fights with her fists and feet. Rapidly pushing the attack button
  links punches and kicks together to create combos.\n
  You can also do a downwards kick while jumping by pressing down+attack in the
  air. She can block hits by defending with her steel plated arm protectors. While
  running, she can also perform a jumping kick.
  .
  2 - Ayane uses a sword to fight and defend herself. Most of her moves are
  similar to Natsumi's except she has a spinning sword attack when attacking in
  the air.
  .
  3 - Haruna. When playing with her for the first time, she may appear to be the
  weakest character. Perhaps to a point where one may think she is useless. But
  first impressions couldn't be further from the truth. She is the most versatile
  character in the game.\n
  Haruna doesn't use close combat moves, instead she throws pins at her
  adversaries. Which don't inflict a great deal of damage. For her second attack
  you need to hold down, then press attack, she will throw a card that shoots
  forwards along the floor and explodes when it makes contact with an enemy. This
  attack can be charged up to do more damage.
  .
  Her defensive move is a magic shield which hurts enemies when they touch it, but
  takes a second to charge up. Her dash attack ends with her tumbling and falling
  face first in the dirt. Told you she wasn't good in physical attacks.
  .
  She also can take 3 different stances, from which very powerful attacks are
  possible. But using these stances in the heat of battle might be a bit tricky,
  so practice will be necessary to get the most out of them. The first stance is
  done by holding the L2 button. While doing this you must rapidly tap the attack
  button 4 times. Haruna will then shoot a little magic bomb which will stun
  enemies. Leaving them open to your attacks.\n
  Her 2nd stance is with R1. Keep this pressed and she will hold up a scroll. Now
  rapidly tap the attack button 8 times to summon a female warrior who will
  deliver 3 devastating blows. Her last stance uses the R2 button. Hold this down
  and rapidly tap the attack button 6 times. With this she sets the ground on fire
  just before her feet.

developer: Atlus
publisher: Atlus
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  A turn-based, strategy RPG, Kartia presents players with two disparate, yet
  intersecting storylines: one as the shrine warrior, Lacryma Christi; the other
  as Toxa Classico, an arrogant knight. Having selected a character, players
  embark on a journey spanning 18 chapters, each of which is preceded by pertinent
  dialogue and FMV scenes, the former accompanied by character portraits from
  Yoshitaka Amano (best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series). The
  titular Kartia represents the lifeblood of the world of Rebus, as it is from
  this that almost anything can be created. Prior to and during each skirmish,
  Kartia can be used to fashion spells, equipment, and phantoms by assembling the
  various elements each entity requires.
  .
  Everything created in the game comprises three elements: the necessary text,
  proper grammar and the Kartia on which to write it (three forms of Kartia exist,
  namely, Silk, Mithril, and WorldTree, each more powerful than the last), and it
  is these elements that are most sought after throughout the game. Phantom
  creatures, the foot soldiers of the piece, are aligned according to Common,
  Doll, and Shadow types, and analogous to the simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game,
  each fares better or worse against a one of the others. Although expendable in
  battle, phantoms will, like their human counterparts, gain in experience over
  time and increase in power and ability.
  .
  The battlefields on which players engage the enemy are susceptible to damage,
  and excessive spell use will scorch the land, burn trees to the ground, freeze
  bodies of water and deform the terrain. Additionally, players can trade items
  with a friend or compete in two-player versus competition using their save data
  from the single-player adventure.

description:
  King's Field is the first game in the King's Field role-playing video game
  series. Like all its successors, the game is played through first person view in
  a dark and mysterious, medieval fantasy setting.
  .
  The game was developed by the Japanese video game company From Software, and
  released December 16, 1994 in Japan, making it the first RPG released for the
  PlayStation. Since it was never published outside Japan, this game is commonly
  known as King's Field (Japan) in the U.S. The game has later received a fan
  translation in English. A complete remake was released in 2000 as part of the
  Sword of Moonlight: King's Field Making Tool software suite for Windows PCs;
  also released only in Japan.
  .
  STORY:\n
  There was a small country called Verdite surrounded by a deep forest, encircled
  by fog and whirling winds. In ancient days, when a great battle was fought and
  many were dying, Verdite was saved by a person who then disappeared into the
  forest. Only the forest's drifting fog knew who this person was... The citizens
  called their savior the Dragon of the Forest and built a sanctuary and honored
  this person there. Eventually, only a legend remained and the Sanctuary was
  changed into the Royal Graveyard and all was silent. But, the legend says,
  "Someday the Dragon of the Forest shall return, bearing Magical Artifacts."
  However, the time has not yet come and the Sanctuary sleeps deeply...
  .
  GAMEPLAY:\n
  The original King's Field is the first of the first-person fantasy RPG King's
  Field series. It was released in Japan weeks after the launch of the
  PlayStation, and never localized or released elsewhere. When King's Field II was
  later released in the West, it was renamed King's Field for those regions.
  .
  In this game, the player controls John Alfred Forrester looking for his missing
  father inside lost, haunted ruins. The journey takes him through a five-level
  dungeon populated by friendly NPCs and deadly traps and monsters. The entire
  world, including objects, enemies, and the player's own equipment, is rendered
  with 3D textured polygons.
  .
  The player collects gold and items from slain enemies, and can purchase weapons
  and spells at two shops located within the dungeon. Weapons and magic are
  assigned to different buttons so the player can easily attack with both,
  however, recharging action bars for each prevent rapidly spamming attacks.
  Skills and stats increase with use, and items can be bought or collected that
  raise specific stats when used (green Verdite stones raise magic, for example).
  The final boss can only be defeated with magic, encouraging players to grind a
  rounded character to to a maximum level.
  .
  Each level of the dungeon holds enemies more difficult than the last, as well as
  greater rewards. The game takes place entirely within the narrow walls of the
  dungeon, with the only "safe" areas on the first floor. Players can save their
  progress to the memory card by activating crosses mounted on walls throughout
  the levels.

game: Klonoa - Door to Phantomile (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Klonoa - Door to Phantomile (USA)/Klonoa - Door to Phantomile (USA).json
developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
genre: Platform
description:
  Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a side-scrolling platform game viewed from a
  "2.5D" perspective. The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a
  two-dimensional fashion, but the game is rendered in three dimensions. This
  allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects
  outside of the path. The game is divided by levels called "Visions", where the
  player progresses by following a path with defeatable computer-controlled
  enemies and puzzles that must be solved. At the end of some levels, the player
  must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy. The player defeats enemies by utilizing
  Klonoa's weapon, the "Wind Bullet", a ring that fires a burst of wind. If the
  wind hits an enemy, Klonoa lifts the enemy above his head. From this position,
  he can throw the enemy into another enemy to defeat them, or use the enemy to
  perform a double-jump (a jump of increased height allowing for new locations to
  be reached). If the player holds the jump button, Klonoa floats in mid-air for a
  short duration, which increases the jump length. Environmental factors such as
  small, localized tornadoes and springboards launch Klonoa up or forward,
  allowing the player to overcome obstacles.

genre: Action;Platform;Racing;Sports
description:
  This game is the first volume of a series of compilations of MSX computer games
  released by Konami only in Japan. It was also released on the Sega Saturn.
  .
  This compilation includes the classic games:
  .
  .
  â¢ Konami's Boxing (1984):
  .
  A boxing game with a couple of moves, with the standard jabs complimented by
  body punches and the ability to dodge, duck or raise your guard. Each punch
  weakens your opponent's strength, although going long enough without being hit
  can see this begin to recover. A rain of blows can produce a quick knockout, but
  in general you must hit him many times, and then with a knockout blow, to see
  him go down. There is a referee. The game has a two player option.
  .
  â¢ Konami's Ping-Pong (1985):
  .
  From Konami's coin-op, Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis.
  To win each match you must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores
  reach 10-9 the game goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a
  similar manner to tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing
  abilities as the game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving
  first, and as the serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have
  more chances to serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15
  in the scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning
  margins, as you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point
  of the winning margin.
  .
  â¢ Hyper Sports 2 (1985):
  .
  Three tough events await in this joystick-waggling action game. The full
  sequence of events is - skeet shooting, archery and weightlifting. You must
  complete each event in order to be allowed onto the next one.
  .
  â¢ Mopiranger (1985):
  .
  The peaceful land of the Mopira have been invaded by the Razons. In this
  platform game you 'll play Mopiranger and you have to save the young Moplits,
  who have been kidnapped by the dastardly Razons. The levels are build in a
  maze-like pattern in which you have to find and rescue the young Moplits from
  the hostile Razons. Using the obstacles present in the game you can block the
  Razons, but also lock yourself in...
  .
  â¢ Antarctic Adventure (1984):
  .
  As a penguin, you must travel around Antarctica, making your way between bases
  before time runs out. This sounds easy, right? Wrong. Hindering your progress
  will be ice crevices and leopard seals. You can jump over the crevices, but
  jumping over the leopard seals may be difficult. You can speed up or slow down
  the penguin to avoid both of these hazards. The bases include Australia, France,
  New Zealand, USA, Argentina, UK, and Japan. You can collect flags and eat fish
  for points. Collecting a flashing flag will allow you to wear a propeller that
  enable you to fly over those hazards.
  .
  â¢ Yie Ar Kung-Fu (1984):
  .
  Based on the popular arcade game, Yie Ar Kung-Fu follows Oolong's quest to
  become a Kung-Fu master. Of course this involves fighting a wide range of
  opponents in a traditional one-on-one 2D environment. Oolong has a wide range of
  attacks he can use to lower his opponent's life bar, including traditional
  punching and kicking attacks as well as jumping ones. Opponents are well armed
  with unique weapons and attacks, so Oolong's task won't be easy.
  .
  â¢ Road Fighter (1985):
  .
  A top view racing game. You have to reach the finish line before time runs out.
  Don't crash into the wall, cars or trucks. Because if you do you will lose
  gasoline. You can get additional gasoline by picking up fuel items. Especially
  avoid the purple cars, they do change lanes! And remember... oil makes road
  slippery...
  .
  â¢ Sky Jaguar (1984):
  .
  Vertical shooter. When a weakened and vulnerable Earth is invaded by the vicious
  Zephyr army, the planet's only hope is a fleet of powerful ships, the Sky
  Jaguars. It 'll take sharp reflexes and amazing skills to survive the
  Zephyrians' unrelenting assault... can you last long enough to discover and
  destroy the enemy's hidden headquarters?
  .
  â¢ Gradius (1986):
  .
  The people of Gradius are in trouble. The ameoboid Bacterions have launched an
  all out attack against the planet, and it's up to you to fly into battle and
  save them. Along the way you'll be able to power up your ship with hyper speed,
  force fields, lasers, missiles, double beam cannons and more to help you battle.
  Based on the arcade game, Gradius is a side scrolling shooter. Shooting certain
  enemies will leave a power up pod behind which can be collected to add more
  power to your ship. Each level features a wide variety of enemies trying to stop
  you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one player or two players
  alternating.
  .
  â¢ Gofer no Yabou: Episode 2 (1988):
  .
  Also known as Nemesis 3 - The Eye Of Destruction. Gradius 3 is a vertical
  scrolling shoot 'm up. Shooting at certain enemies will leave a power up pod
  behind which can be collected to add more power to your space ship (for example
  special weapons or a force field). Every level features a wide variety of
  enemies trying to stop you, with a large boss at the end. Gameplay is for one
  player or two players alternating. In Gradius 3 the planet Gradius is involved
  in 3 space wars: versus Bacterion, Venom and Salamander!

  In LSD the player navigates through a psychedelic dream world. The idea is

  results in a stranger dream.

  Each dream can last up to 10 minutes, after which the player will 'wake up',
  when the screen fades away and the player is sent back to the game's initial
  menu. However, if the player falls off a cliff or into a hole in the dream, then
  the player will wake up immediately. There is a graph that appears at the end of
  each dream that keeps track of the player's state of mind; the states are Upper,

  back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to
  new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life
  energy at a constant rate.

developer: Gremlin Interactive
publisher: Interplay Entertainment
genre: Action
description:
  Set against the backdrop of an inter-galactic penal colony, Loaded sees players,
  as one of six psychotic inmates, attempting to navigate fifteen enemy-laden
  levels en route to their ultimate goal; the killing of the sadistic warden --
  known as FUB (Fat Ugly Boy) -- of said penal colony. The characters, with names
  such as Butch, FWANK, Cap N Hands, Mamma, Bounca, and Vox run the gamut from
  cross-dressing freaks and cyborg pirates to demented clowns and female
  cyber-criminals. All are rated in a handful of categories; each possessing
  differing speed, vitality and damage potential attributes. Armed with their
  character's weapon of choice, up to two players can blast their way through
  stages populated by fellow inmates, guards, straight-jacket laden mental
  patients, rats, and more. While objectives are present, the basic formula
  amounts to scouring each level in search of color-coded keys that will allow you
  to advance further into the level, while blasting hostiles and collecting
  ammunition and health power-ups to replenish your reserves. A small on-screen
  map allows you to find your way through the maze-like stages.
  .
  Each character is also capable of performing a strafe maneuver to avoid enemy
  attacks. In addition to the rudimentary health and ammunition boxes, power-ups
  can be obtained that increase the power of your weapon, temporarily freeze
  enemies, make you invisible for a brief period of time, imbue your character
  with limited invulnerability, or make you faster, with unlimited ammo for a set
  time. Should the overwhelming tide of enemies prove too much, each character is
  also capable of unleashing a set number of smart bomb-esque weapons that will
  clear all on-screen enemies. The action is viewed from a top-down perspective,
  and can be zoomed in or out as desired. Coins can be collected throughout each
  level and at the end of each stage, you'll be given a Greed rating based upon
  the amount you gathered.
  .
  Features:\n
  Choose from six hardened criminals, from lithe females to brutish bouncers\n
  Blast your way through fifteen maze-like levels\n
  Acquire power-ups and weapon upgrades to help keep the tides of enemies at bay

  Magic: The Gathering - Battlemage is the real-time adaptation of the popular
  Magic collectible card game. The player assumes the role of a planeswalker, a
  powerful magician in the world of Dominaria, the world containing the most
  magical energy in Magic's universe of Dominia.
  .
  The goal of the player is to defeat one opposing planeswalker in the Duel mode
  of the game, or to wage a campaign against all five of his rivals on a
  thirty-territory map comprising the continent of Corondor. To achieve victory,
  the player must cast spells against his opponent, which take the form of
  creatures and energy that will attack the player's adversary. At the same time,
  the player's rival is also casting spells, in an effort to destroy the player's
  planeswalker.
  .
  The spells at the player's disposal are drawn from the Magic collectible card
  game, from their 4th edition and Mirage sets. These spells are depicted by icons
  intended to "represent" each spell, which must be identified in order that the
  player cast the spell intended.

developer: Bullfrog
publisher: Electronic Arts
genre: Flight Simulator;Shooter
description:
  First released on PC way back in 1994, and then remade for the original
  PlayStation, Magic Carpet is in essence a free-movement FPS. Taking on the role
  of a magician on a magic carpet, youâll run through around 50 levels, killing
  stuff with magic and then collecting its âmana.â Collect enough mana and the
  next level is opened up.
  .
  The stuff being killed is not defenceless though â far from it. Enemies range
  from relatively harmless vultures, right through to swarms of undead,
  firespitting dragons and titanic wyverns. Thereâs also other mages to contend
  with â in some levels as many as seven - and thatâs where the toughest
  challenges are at.
  .
  Each mage possesses a castle. As long as the castle exists, the mage has a
  spawning point should he/ she die. The castle is upgradable provided the mage
  has collected enough mana, so levels quickly fall into a rhythm that is split
  evenly between fighting the wildlife to collect mana, protecting your own
  castle, and then attacking your âhumanâ opponents.
  .
  So far it probably all sounds pretty standard, but Magic Carpet has a host of
  ideas that work so well, the game still remains relevant today. The maps are
  reasonably small (by todayâs standards), but they really are open â each map is
  filled with secrets and dangers to find and avoid. The levels are also morphable
  â it is possible to destroy environments as it was possible to create volcanoes
  and gaping chasms.
  .
  There is also a huge range of spells to collect and use â 24 in total â ranging
  from standard shield and health regeneration, through to more aggressive
  fireballs and the awesome destructive might of meteors.

description:
  The events begin in 11,000 BC when a meteorite from Mars strikes the Antarctic
  ice. It isn't until 1984 that it is discovered by mankind and labeled ALH 84001.
  A dozen years later, NASA's analysis is complete and the existence of alien
  microfossils confirmed. In 2009, a manned mission to Mars to investigate
  bacterial life is launched with the establishment of the Vita 1 base the result.
  .
  And now, in 2018, all communication with the base has been terminated. Vita 1's
  last message is the enigmatic: "If you send a manned craft, warn the crew to
  stay alone, stay alive." Nearly a year later, a team sent to investigate
  survives a crash on the Martian surface and arrives at the derelict base.
  Following the advice of the last message from Vita 1, each member enters the
  base through a separate airlock.
  .
  In Martian Gothic: Unification, a survival-horror adventure, you play as all
  three team members, guiding each on his or her path of exploration to solve the
  mysteries of Vita 1 and Mars itself. The team must work together, yet remain
  apart, to discover the cause of the infection plaguing them at the base and
  eventually uncover the ancient secret buried deep below the Martian surface.
  .
  In a script written by science fiction author Stephen Marley, you'll guide the
  actions of the three members from a third-person perspective, reminiscent of
  Resident Evil. Each member carries an inventory, health and poison indicator and
  a weapon. The action unfolds as the members explore the environment and discover
  objects, computers, storage bins, bodies and vacuum tubes used to transport
  items around the base to each other.
  .
  Game saves are accomplished through access of the Vita 1 base computer system.
  It contains unrestricted, restricted and local information about the base as
  well as a videogame called Martian Mayhem II, generally considered the "worst
  game in the history of videogaming" (the game's development began in 1998 and
  finally hit store shelves in December 2017). The number of saves available at
  each computer station is limited, thus requiring the eventual use of more than
  one.

  Explore the Red Planet through the eyes of Matlock, Kenzo and Karne as you
  discover a secret older than humanity itself in Martian Gothic: Unification.

developer: NMS Software Ltd.
publisher: ASC
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  With little in the way of story elements, Mass Destruction's title alone tells
  you exactly what this game is about. Played throughout a scorched Earth, you'll
  shoot anything and everything in your path as you control one of three available
  tanks. Each tank has different armor and speed statistics: the Cheetah is a
  speedy tank built for hit and run operations; the Cobra lacks maneuverability
  but has highly destructive capabilities; and the Viper is an able firehouse
  without the armor capabilities of the Cobra.
  .
  Regardless of which tank you've chosen, they all begin with a 100mm Cannon and a
  chain gun. Among the various weapons you'll encounter are hi-explosive shells
  that explode on contact, mines, mortars, Torus Bombs that surround the tank with
  an explosion ring, flamethrowers and guided missiles.
  .
  Played from an overhead 3D third-person perspective, the game is divided into
  four areas. Areas consist of a variety of mission objectives that must be
  completed; in addition to primary missions, some include secondary objectives.
  While primary objectives (24 in all) must be completed in order to claim victory
  for the overall mission, secondary objectives act as additional bonus points.
  There are also bonus and hidden objectives that award the player with bonus
  points. By completing hidden objectives, you'll be rewarded with new missions!
  .
  Mass Destruction requires one memory card block for saving game data and
  supports analog controls. So get in there and destroy anything that moves!
  .
  Features:\n
  * Blast through 24 combat missions\n
  * Hit your enemies with flame throwers, guided missiles, vortex bombs, and
  more\n
  * Choose from three tank classes

game: Medal of Honor (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Medal of Honor (USA)/Medal of Honor (USA).json
developer: Dreamworks Interactive
publisher: Electronic Arts
genre: Shooter
description:
  The year is 1944. On the eve of what will be known ever after as the D-day
  invasion, the Air Transport Corps initiated the largest drop of troops yet seen
  by the Allied Forces. The plan couldn't have gone any worse: planes flew past
  their targets, those that came close were quickly shot down, and the inclement
  weather made it difficult to see where the pilots were heading. Yet in the midst
  of this colossal failure, a glimmer of hope emerged.
  .
  A 24-year-old Lieutenant by the name of Jimmy Patterson persevered through the
  chaos and made sure that his regiment reached its scheduled drop zone. At least
  until his C-47 transport plane was cut to shreds by enemy fire. Faced with a
  group of injured men and harrowing odds, Patterson took it upon himself to fend
  off repeated attacks from German patrols until help arrived. When all was said
  and done, the young Lieutenant killed six men and was nominated for the
  Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery. He was a hero.
  .
  Patterson was then sent to an infirmary where he could heal his wounds suffered
  from protecting his crew. In a few days, Germany would be left behind, for a
  well-deserved return home to the States. While the soldier was scheduled to
  receive a War Bonds tour upon his arrival, it would apparently have to wait. The
  infirmary bed would be empty by the time the nurse made her rounds, and the
  story that follows is one of epic proportions. It is one that you create.
  .
  Medal of Honor is the story of Jimmy Patterson, a soldier recruited to work for
  the OSS (Office of Strategic Services). Inspired by acclaimed film director
  Steven Spielberg, the game is a first-person shooter that takes place amidst the
  events surrounding World War II. Spanning seven different missions and 24
  levels, Medal of Honor features search and rescue assignments, commando raids,
  and espionage. You will be able to find and use 11 historically authentic
  weapons to fight 20 different types of German troops, from the Wermacht Light
  Infantry to the Elite Heavy Shock Troops.
  .
  As you progress through the castles, twisting city streets, mountain
  strongholds, and other locales making up the game, you'll be able to take out
  the Nazis with the following armaments: Colt45, German Walther P38, Thompson
  SMG, Bazooka, Mark II Frag Grenade, Sniper Gewehr 41, Shotgun, M1 Garand, MP40
  SMG, Browning Automatic Rifle, and Stielhandgranate (a.k.a. Potato Masher).
  .
  In a departure from traditional first-person shooters on console systems, time
  was spent on Medal of Honor to make the enemy AI behave as realistically as
  possible. Guards will duck to avoid fire, visibly react to specific hits to
  their bodies, throw back grenades, sound alarms, and even ask you for your
  papers. Papers? Yes, some missions will require the use of a Nazi uniform to
  disguise yourself from your enemies! Just make sure you have the right
  documentation when asked, or the situation may turn deadly.
  .
  Before donning your combat boots and starting your tour of duty, you'll be able
  to adjust gameplay options, view records on completed missions, witness
  authentic background footage on the events surrounding WWII, and receive
  briefings on the upcoming missions from the animated War Room. Players can also
  elect to challenge a friend in the head-to-head multiplayer mode.
  .
  The multiplayer mode lets players select their character and up to seven types
  of uniforms (more can be earned as you unlock hidden features while playing
  through the single-player game). There are two types of games to play in your
  choice of seven theaters (or levels): Timed Match or Wins Match. The length of
  Timed Matches can be further customized to 2, 5, 10, 21, or unlimited time,
  while Wins Matches can consist of 3, 10 or 21 wins. No matter which mode you
  choose, the object is the same: take out your opponent before he or she takes
  out you!
  .
  In an attempt to create a realistic atmosphere, the developers sought the advice
  of Capt. Dale Dye, USMC (ret.), who previously served as a consultant for
  Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, and Saving Private Ryan. Other notable
  features include an original score composed by Michael Giacchino, both analog
  control and vibration function support, and the option to save up to 15 games to
  a single memory card. As the title suggests, you will be able to receive up to
  seven medals based on your performance during each mission. Win all seven to
  receive a secret code and special movie!

developer: Dreamworks Interactive
publisher: Electronic Arts
genre: Shooter
description:
  The year is 1940, and the conquering force of the Third Reich has invaded
  France. Nazi Germany has marched into Paris and claimed the once proud nation as
  its own in its further quest for domination of Europe. The allied forces won't
  be coming to liberate France any time soon, as they have their hands full
  protecting Great Britain. The perception that the French have simply let Hitler
  walk into their country without a fight has not endeared the rest of the
  war-torn world to the cause.
  .
  As a young woman named Manon Batiste, you will be thrust into the world of
  intrigue and violence that is World War II doing all you can to save your
  beloved homeland by joining the OSS and traveling the world as a member of the
  French Underground, taking out Gestapo thugs and the SS so that you might become
  a seasoned veteran and aid in the ultimate liberation of your nation.
  .
  Medal of Honor: Underground is the prequel to 1999's popular Medal of Honor, the
  first-person shooter that threw you into the turmoil of WWII and up against the
  Nazis. This prequel is designed on the same 3D engine as the first, only this
  time players will be wrapped up in the French Underground, making their way
  through the Underground and assaulting Nazi outposts in France, Egypt and other
  foreign locations.
  .
  The focus of the game is the single-player campaign, which will pit the player,
  controlling Manon, against all manner of Nazi militia. When players begin one of
  the 24 different missions, they will be given briefings detailing the objective
  of that specific operation, be it finding a specific target to assassinate or
  locating plans and objects that will aide the Underground in its fight against
  Hitler.
  .
  The developers have attempted to fill each locale with the realism of the actual
  global conflict. To this effect, you will have computer-controlled compatriots
  who will occasionally fight alongside you, as well as enemies who possess
  realistic damage models, where head and chest shots do far more damage than
  shots to the extremities. Also, each of the twelve weapons contained in the game
  are authentic to the era and place of combat.
  .
  The game will also occasionally allow you to hop into enemy vehicles, such as
  tanks and motorcycles. You can take pictures of enemies and use them with your
  own faked credentials to beat border guards and snooping storm troopers. Beyond
  the single-player game, Medal of Honor: Underground also features multiplayer
  play for two people, letting them choose different environments from the game to
  do battle in.

developer: SCE Cambridge Studio
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment Europe
genre: Platform
description:
  MediEvil tells the tale of Sir Daniel Fortesque, a man with a gift for
  storytelling. Though he never actually performed any of the wondrous deeds he so
  often boasted about, the king knighted him and appointed him as the head of the
  Royal Battalion. You see, the king liked stories, and truthful or not, Sir
  Daniel's stories were the best. Besides, Gallowmere hadn't seen a war in
  centuries...
  .
  After years in exile, the evil magician Zarok returned to the land of Gallowmere
  with an unholy army in tow. In desperation, the king ordered Sir Daniel to lead
  his army against that of Zarok's. However, Sir Daniel's battle is short-lived,
  as the first arrow fired in battle fatally wounds him. The king's army manages
  to drive back the demon hordes, and to save face, the king declares that Sir
  Daniel Fortesque died an honorable death only moments after killing Zarok.
  One-hundred years later, Zarok returns, casting an evil spell over the land that
  turns all the villagers into beasts of unimaginable evil. In doing so, he also
  unwittingly raises Sir Daniel from the dead, who must now atone for his ignoble
  death and defeat the sorcerer.
  .
  As you traipse across the now cursed land of Gallowmere, you'll need to pick up
  life bottles and energy vials. The former acts as an extra life of sorts
  (refilling your energy bar when it is depleted), while the latter tops up your
  energy. To ensure that you don't lose too much of that vital energy, you'll
  acquire an arsenal of weapons including a crossbow, broadsword, axe and throwing
  daggers. Supplies for your weapons can be purchased from Merchant Gargoyles
  using treasure found on your travels.
  .
  Sir Daniel's task is a simple one, as he must navigate through each level and
  destroy any enemies and boss characters that get in his way. By collecting rune
  stones, locked areas can be accessed, allowing our hero to forge ahead towards
  his ultimate destiny. As enemies are dispatched, the Chalice of Souls will be
  filled up. When it's full, Sir Daniel will be able to collect it. In doing so,
  he is granted access to the Hall of Heroes, where true heroes from a bygone era
  reward the player with new items and the like. Levels vary in both design and
  theme, running the gamut from possessed pumpkin patches to malevolent town
  squares.

  in an unspecified year during the 21st century (20XX). The game opens as two
  alien robots engage in a climactic battle in the depths of space. Ultimately
  both of them plummet towards Earth, critically injured. Meanwhile, Mega Man and
  his canine companion Rush are called by Dr. Light to investigate strange energy
  readings on a nearby island. On the island, Mega Man finds Dr. Wily flying away
  with a strange purple orb. Before chasing him, he sees a damaged robot and asks
  for Dr. Light to pick it up and try to repair it. Dr. Wily then releases four
  new Robot Masters to combat Mega Man, Frost Man, Tengu Man, Clown Man, and
  Grenade Man. Each time he destroys one, the robotic hero receives a purple orb
  like the one Dr. Wily confiscated. Each of the Robot Masters are empowered with
  a strange energy, and it seems that this power comes from the new energy cores
  that Wily has infused them with.

description:
  In a world covered almost entirely in water, there exist small islands that hide
  huge treasures. And where there's treasure, you can find treasure hunters called
  Diggers, who live for the thrill of the hunt...
  .
  Barrel Casket was once one of the greatest Diggers, but he has now retired. He
  now cares for his young granddaughter, Roll, whose parents disappeared while on
  a dig. He had also discovered a strange baby boy in some ruins one time, who he
  also took under his care alongside Roll. He named the baby boy Rock Voulnut, and
  Rock grew up to be an expert Digger, sometimes known by his nickname, MegaMan.
  .
  While out exploring one day, Rock, Roll, and Barrel's airship, the Flutter,
  crash lands on an island named Kattelox. As they explore Kattelox in hopes of
  fixing their ship, they hear word of a huge treasure, the legendary Mother Lode,
  that is buried somewhere on the island. Rock, Roll, and Barrel decide to look
  for the treasure, but at the same time, they're going to get a little
  competition from a pirate family named the Bonnes...

  Taking place in an ambiguous year in the 22nd century (21XX) and following the
  third defeat of the "Maverick" robot Sigma, Cain Labs issues an initiative to
  create a supplementary military force to complement the "Maverick Hunters". The
  army, called the "Repliforce", is a strict regime led by General and his
  second-in-command, Colonel. Six months following the inception of the group,
  Cain Labs finds its methods to be ineffective, questionable, and potentially
  dangerous in the Maverick defense. To make matters worse, behind the scenes,
  General has been meeting with a mysterious figure who plots the Hunters' demise,
  insinuating that they are a significant threat to the jurisdiction of the
  Maverick Hunters. Mayhem breaks out when the Sky Lagoon, a massive floating
  city, is sent crashing down onto the city below it, killing millions of
  civilians, humans and Reploids alike. The game begins here where either X or
  Zero is dispatched to investigate possible causes of the disaster only to become
  entangled, once again, in a struggle against Sigma to save the world.

description:
  A semi-sequel/prequel to the highly acclaimed Metal Gear Solid (MGS), Metal Gear
  Solid: VR Missions puts you once again in control of the top-level FoxHound
  field specialist, Solid Snake. This time around, instead of fighting genetically
  engineered soldiers and saving the world from Metal Gear, you're in a combat
  simulator. Aboard the Discovery (the submarine that Solid Snake traveled upon
  before reaching Angel Island), you will prepare for the dangers ahead.
  .
  For those that have yet to experience MGS, the gameplay is based around
  strategy, tactics and action. Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions's interface and
  concept is similar to its predecessor, but is based on the simulator game mode
  that was included in MGS. This time, instead of just a few missions, you have
  nearly 150 different stages to play (300 including the Time Attack modes). Fans
  of MGS should be able to quickly pick up on the gameplay style. In fact, not
  only is the gameplay recognizable by fans of the original Metal Gear Solid, each
  of the missions (although similarities are sometimes minute) are based on events
  that occurred in MGS.

genre: Action;Adventure;Puzzle;Role-Playing

  Things are looking up for the Bonne family. Having just finished getting their
  airship, the Gesellschaft, operational, Teisel Bonne sets out with younger
  brother Bon Bonne to explore an unexplored ruin. Unfortunately for Teisel the
  loan he took out to pay for the Gesellschaft just came due, and the two Bonne
  brothers are taken prisoner. Now it's up to Tron to save her siblings and pay
  off their debt the only way she knows how: Grand Larceny.
  .
  Most of the levels in The Misadventures of Tron Bonne are played similarly to
  Mega Man Legends, but with minor tweaks to controls. Tron's walking tank, the
  Gustaff, can't equip the wide range of alternate weapons like Mega Man, but it
  can pick up and hurl large objects like trees and cars. It can also launch
  beacon bombs which direct the Servbots following Tron to either attack or steal
  anything in the vicinity. Additional levels include a crate stacking puzzle
  minigame where Tron needs to steal selected crates of valuables in a limited
  number of moves, and a first person dungeon exploration section where Tron must
  depend on the Servbots alone to clear out traps and enemies. Despite the
  Servbots all looking alike, each one has unique stats and abilities. By taking
  them on missions, training them aboard the Gesellschaft, or using special items
  their stats can be raised, unlocking hidden talents.

  Monster Seed obviously takes influence from the popular animal raising/fighting
  genre; specifically games like PokÃ©mon and Monster Rancher. Of course, it does
  do a few things differently. One major difference is the fantasy setting. No
  ranches or medical settings here, no sir. Another key difference is in the
  overall presentation; Monster Seed's gameplay and interface are a lot more
  simple than most other breeding games.
  .
  Similar to mother games in the genre, there's a brief tutorial of sorts, and
  then you're off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other
  breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if
  they die in battle, they're gone for good. Granted you can always breed more,
  but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but
  you lost a level twelve.

developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
genre: Puzzle
description:
  Mr. Driller loves to drill. So when Downtown was mysteriously overrun with
  colored blocks, he was the obvious choice to get to the bottom of the situation.
  Armed with his trusty jackhammer, he begins his descent toward the Earth's core.
  .
  Our hero can drill up, down, left and right. Drilling through single blocks
  would take forever, so it's fortunate that blocks of the same color form into
  groups that vanish when only one of the blocks is drilled. This allows for chain
  reactions, since vanishing blocks will often cause other blocks to fall and form
  new groups. Alas, these falling blocks are also deadly if they hit Mr. Driller.
  .
  If all Mr. Driller had to do was drill, life would be easy. But he also has to
  keep refilling his oxygen supply by collecting air capsules scattered throughout
  the blocks. The deeper he goes, the faster his air runs out. Hampering his
  progress even further are brown "X-blocks" that take five drill strikes to
  disappear and remove 20% of Mr. Driller's air when broken.
  .
  The Arcade game consists of two courses: Easy (2,500 feet) and Hard (5,000
  feet). A course is completed when Mr. Driller reaches the target depth. Bonus
  points are awarded if the course is finished in record time or if Mr. Driller
  has lives to spare (30,000 per life). Each single block is worth ten points;
  groups of four or more earn 40 points per block; and air capsules earn points on
  an increasing scale: 100 for the first, 200 for the second, 300 for the third,
  etc.
  .
  The PlayStation version features two additional modes: Survival and Time Attack.
  In Survival mode, Mr. Driller must drill as deep as he can using only one life.
  He can begin at the surface, 5,000 feet or 10,000 feet. In Time Attack, Mr.
  Driller must drill through a predetermined course and beat the record time.
  Instead of air capsules, he collects clocks to decrease the timer. Initially,
  there are only four available courses, but more are unlocked when those are
  completed.
  .
  Features:\n
  * Quickly drill through colored blocks before your air supply runs out\n
  * Features three play modes: Arcade, Time Attack, and Survival\n
  * Save progress and high scores to memory card

description:
  After escaping from Tomator in The Lost Vikings, Erik, Olaf, and Baleog have
  lived joyous and fruitful Viking lives. Then one day, after returning home from
  a fishing trip, the Vikings get captured by Tomator again. Tomator then calls
  upon a robotic guard to send them into the Arena, which unfortunately falls
  short when a system failure happens. During the blackout, the three Vikings
  dismantle the robot piece by piece and wear its parts on their body, thus
  granting them new abilities. The three Vikings are then sent through time once
  again when Olaf pulls the switch on the time machine that says "Do Not Touch",
  which he mistakes for donuts. Equipped with the new robotic gear from the robot
  guard they destroyed earlier, Erik, Olaf, and Baleog must fight their way
  through time once again in order to find their way back home. Along the way,
  they befriend a wolf named Fang (whom they continuously humorously mistake for a
  different animal) and a dragon named Scorch.

genre: Action;Adventure
description:
  Linda, Toshi and Dave, three members of an occult group of a senior high school
  end up missing while investigating a mansion in a town in southern Europe.
  Linda, one of the group sent her mother photos of spirits she captured inside
  the mansion before she disappeared.
  .
  You are Akira, a freelance journalist. Linda's mother hired you and your
  assistant Angela to find the whereabouts of her daughter and the two other kids
  she was with.
  .
  The Note is an action adventure survival horror title, you move around the
  levels in a first person view and can interact with almost everything in the
  rooms. Curtains can be opened, fireplaces can be lit (granted, if you have any
  wood) and items such as paintings can be examined for additional info.
  .
  The game allows binding functions such as Check, Open or item-based functions
  such as Shotgun or Match to the shoulder-buttons, so you can use doors and
  weapons without going through the menu every single time.
  .
  In the general fashion of survival horror games, you must lit torches or open
  curtains in order to access dark corners, ie. to use a key to a nearby door or
  to examine a painting closely. You must also conserve your ammunition since
  nightly creatures such as rats, bats, werewolves and zombies roam the levels.
  .
  You can exit the levels and visit the city where you can buy and sell supplies,
  rest or save your game. These parts work much like menu based role playing
  games.

developer: Polyphony Digital
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
genre: Action;Shooter
description:
  For centuries the intelligence known as AlphaCore has been growing inside of
  human computer networks, slyly and invisibly pushing humanity to build more of
  it and allow it to control more of the network. On the eve of AlphaCore's
  complete assimilation of all technology, humanity becomes aware of it, and
  rather than bow down to it as king, as it expected, they attempt to purge it
  from the network. In response AlphaCore defends itself, locking all of humanity
  out of their technology and assuming total control of their weapons. Not long
  after this AlphaCore learns of a desperate plot: to build a time machine and
  travel back in time to remove AlphaCore's influence from humanity. AlphaCore
  steals this technology and hatches its own plan: traveling back in time to 1945
  and inserting itself into the first computer ever built, ensuring that humanity
  would forever be subtle pawns in its machinations. It now falls upon the
  shoulders of Lester J. Henning, pilot of the experimental robot weapon Omega
  Boost, to travel back in time, stop AlphaCore's plan, and restore free choice to
  humanity.
  .
  The Omega Boost flies through levels on a predetermined path, although it can
  brake and boost in a direction to avoid hazards. The Omega Boost can fire a
  Vulcan rifle at enemies without targeting, or can lock on to and attack many
  targets at once with a homing laser. By scoring well in levels, the Omega Boost
  will gain the ability to lock onto more targets at once, and eventually unlock
  the Viper Boost, a powerful area attack that must cool down after being used.
  Levels completed in campaign mode can be replayed at your leisure in Zone mode,
  and bonus levels can be unlocked as well by achieving certain milestones.

developer: Visual Concepts

genre: Shooter
description:
  The unwitting recipient of a destructive prosthesis -- a powerful blaster
  grafted onto his left arm -- John Cain awakes to find himself being hunted down
  by a military organization, with no recollection of the events leading to this
  predicament. Inspired by Contra and other such titles, One is a pseudo-3D
  scrolling shooter in which players find themselves traversing a variety of
  locales, from futuristic Blade Runner-esque cities to remote mountainous
  regions, all in search of answers. The central gameplay mechanic is the player's
  Rage meter. Simply put, John Cain is fueled by rage. By destroying objects,
  killing people, and generally causing all kinds of wanton mayhem, he will
  increase in power. Cain's rage is represented by an orb-like indicator that
  undergoes a number of color changes, from the relative calm of green to an
  infuriated red, and beyond.
  .
  The higher the color, the more damage the character can sustain and, as an added
  bonus, the damage yield of the arm blaster is increased as well. Eventually the
  protagonist will be capable of unleashing a mighty special attack. Taking too
  much damage however, will cause the meter to revert to a lower state. Though his
  primary means of attack is his newfound appendage, John Cain is capable of
  executing melee attacks as well. He can also perform a handful of evasive
  maneuvers, such as rolling, strafing and even a double jump, which must be
  mastered in order to traverse the many platforms and pitfalls that await in the
  title's eight missions. Restart points are scattered throughout the stages and
  players can save their progress at the conclusion of each level.

game: Parasite Eve (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Parasite Eve (USA)/Parasite Eve (USA).json
developer: Squaresoft
publisher: Squaresoft
genre: Horror;Role-Playing
description:
  Parasite Eve is a Japanese science fiction novel by Hideaki Sena, first
  published in Kadokawa Horror Bunko in 1996. The book was published in North
  America by Vertical, Inc. in 2005. Parasite Eve has been adapted into a 1997
  film and a 1998 video game for the Sony PlayStation by Square (now Square Enix).
  Two sequels to the game were released.
  .
  Parasite Eve is a horror action role-playing game developed by SquareSoft (now
  Square Enix). The game is a sequel to the novel Parasite Eve, written by Hideaki
  Sena. It is the first game in the Parasite Eve series.
  .
  The game takes place over a six day span in New York City in 1997. The incident
  starts on December 24 and ends on December 29.
  .
  The game begins with Aya Brea, an NYPD rookie, attending an opera with an
  unnamed date. During the opera, everyone in the building spontaneously combusts,
  except for Aya, her date, and an actress on stage named Melissa Pearce. Aya
  confronts Melissa backstage, and Melissa says that Ayaâs mitochondria need more
  time to develop. Melissa then mutates into a beast and flees into the sewers,
  declaring that her name is now Eve.
  .
  There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only
  rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more
  advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and
  civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if
  mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their
  natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already
  started.
  .
  Mitochondria have taken on a new life of their own and begun to infest the city
  of Manhattan. It's up to NYPD detective Aya Brea to unearth the mystery behind
  this infestation.
  .
  Journey through the dark streets of Manhattan as you battle mutated rats and
  other hideous creatures on your way to Eve, the central figure of the
  mitochondria attacks. Developed by Square, the same people who brought us the
  epic Final Fantasy RPG series, Parasite Eve is a three-disc RPG in a
  third-person perspective with 3D rendered backgrounds.
  .
  You are allowed to roam around in real-time, polygonal battle sequences. A
  unique option lets you customize weapons, armor and character abilities. The
  game is compatible with analog controllers and takes up only one block of memory
  for saves.
  .
  The game package also contains a bonus CD, Square Soft's 1998 Collector's CD
  Vol.1. This collection of demos and previews includes an interactive playable
  demo for Xenogears, the opening movie sequence for Bushido Blade, a preview
  movie for Brave Fencer Musashi, and a special preview movie for Final Fantasy
  VIII.

game: Parasite Eve II (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Parasite Eve II (USA)/Parasite Eve II (USA).json
developer: Squaresoft
publisher: Squaresoft
genre: Horror;Role-Playing
description:
  With a goal of fusing tension and drama found in movies with the game mechanics
  of the role-playing genre, the original Parasite Eve was Square's first attempt
  at creating a cinematic RPG; it was a commercial success, selling loads of
  copies to role-playing and survival horror fanatics. Because of the acclaim, the
  powerhouse development company did the only thing possible -- a sequel.
  .
  Before detailing the follow-up, here's some background: the plot of the original
  game dealt with Eve, a woman transformed into a killing machine by a life form
  known as mitochondria. The infected woman/monster went on a bloody rampage
  through New York City, destroying anything and everyone in her path. Assuming
  the role of a young police officer named Aya Brea, it was in the players' hands
  to solve the murder case and thwart the vile creature; the awaking of her
  mitochondria gave her the clues and prowess to stop the madness of Eve.
  .
  A few years have passed since the occurrences in New York. Aya Brea has joined
  the Federal Bureau of Investigations' Mitochondria Investigation and Suppression
  Team (M.I.S.T for short). After a series of strange incidents, the heroine is
  called into action and ordered to investigate the unfolding mystery once again.
  Human beings have begun transforming into hideous monsters known as Neo
  Mitochondrion Creatures; it is suspected that Eve is behind these bizarre
  events.
  .
  While the look and feel of Parasite Eve II resembles the original, it features
  revamped character models with facial expressions and motion-captured animation,
  pre-rendered backgrounds, an overhauled battle system and full-motion video
  clips for storyline progression; the in-game dialogue is presented in written
  form with text boxes. Spanning dust-ridden ghost towns, elaborate laboratories
  and ancient dwellings, monsters roam about resulting in survival horror elements
  and scares galore!
  .
  Whereas the original featured pseudo turn-based battles, the sequel's action
  sequences unfurl in real-time; you can dodge enemy attacks, run away or
  strategically decimate the opposition. Taking pieces from the sci-fi world, Aya
  Brea has been endowed with psychic powers and psionic spells including
  meditation, healing and offensive fire blasts in addition to conventional
  pistols and machine guns. Once the battle has finished, the heroine will receive
  two point awards: XP and BP. While XP points lean towards learning new spells
  (12 in all), BP points will have you customizing and buying weapons and items;
  enhancing weapons means purchasing or finding the right parts. Items include
  healing and effect-ridding canisters, different types of ammunition and
  important objects vital to the quest.
  .
  Along the way, Aya will come in contact with other characters including a bounty
  hunter named Kyle Madigan, a weapons expert named Gary Douglas and M.I.S.T
  agents Pierce Carradine and Rupert Broderick, all of which offer help and
  advice. Additionally, the various locations are laced with puzzles ranging from
  finding certain key cards to solving riddles and manipulating gears and pictures
  for the sake of progress.
  .
  A single-player experience, Parasite Eve II offers three different endings
  (depending on how well you do) and supports PlayStation memory cards for saving
  game data and the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog controls and the
  vibration function.

publisher: Atlus Software Inc.
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  The first entry in Atlus' modern role-playing franchise, Revelations Series:
  Persona finds players in control of a group of high schoolers who use multiple
  personalities to combat demons and prevent their town from slipping into another
  dimension.
  .
  While playing a children's folklore game, the teenage characters are struck
  unconscious and greeted by a man named Philemon, who imbues within them the
  ability to summon different personalities known as personas. These phantasm-like
  personae serve the role typically assigned to mages or wizards, unleashing a
  variety of different magic attacks on enemies, while the main characters can use
  traditional melee weapons for close-quarters combat or modern guns for ranged
  attacks.
  .
  Gamers need to manage and improve all of these skills, as the SEBEC
  Corporation's newest invention seems to be inviting a constant stream of demons
  from another dimension. Battles present players with an isometric viewpoint of
  the action, while the dungeon-crawling aspect of the game switches to the
  first-person perspective.
  .
  Combat helps characters level up, but physical violence is not always the best
  course of action. Each character can use four different conversational
  techniques to coax items from the demons, and new personas can only be acquired
  by convincing demons to relinquish their spell cards.
  .
  Features\n
  * Use swords, shotguns, and other weapons to defeat over 300 monsters\n

  reluctant to take her case at first. However, after Lorraine leaves his office,
  she is attacked and murdered by a man in a black motorcycle suit. Jonathan,
  unable to catch the culprit, decides to fulfill his ex-wife's final request and

game: R4 - Ridge Racer Type 4 (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/R4 - Ridge Racer Type 4 (USA)/R4 - Ridge Racer Type 4 (USA).json
developer: Namco
publisher: Namco
genre: Racing
description:
  R4 Ridge Racer Type 4 combines the arcade driving action of its predecessors
  with simulation-style elements such as custom cars and participating in a full
  racing season. The game features 45 unique cars (plus over 300 variants), eight
  different tracks and the following three game modes: Grand Prix, Time Attack and
  Versus Battle.
  .
  The heart of the game is the Grand Prix, where you select one of four racing
  teams and embark on a season spanning eight races. By finishing in certain spots
  during the event, you will be able to unlock additional cars. Time Attack has
  you trying to beat the record time for each course, while Versus Battle involves
  challenging a friend on a horizontally-split screen.
  .
  Cars that are earned through the season will be automatically stored in a garage
  awaiting registration. Once registered, the new cars will be eligible for
  competition in either the Versus Battle or Time Attack modes. Players can also
  design their own logos, choose from pre-designed decals or simply change each
  car's color for an added touch of personality.
  .
  The game also supports standard analog controllers, Namco's NeGcon and the 1999
  Jogcon controller. The Jogcon is notable for featuring a built-in dial instead
  of the two sticks found on Sony's Dual Shock Analog Controller. Steering left or
  right is accomplished by using both thumbs on either side of the dial, while the
  shoulder buttons handle acceleration and braking. A motor located behind the
  dial provides force-feedback.
  .
  R4 Ridge Racer Type 4 requires a memory card in order to save option settings,
  unlocked cars, trophies earned during the Grand Prix as well as the top five lap
  and total race times. The game is also compatible with Sony's PocketStation
  (canceled for the U.S. market), which would have allowed players to exchange
  cars with other PocketStations.
  .
  Along with the fourth installment in the series, Namco has included a second
  disc entitled "Ridge Racer Turbo Mode," offering two separate versions of Ridge
  Racer: the 1995 original and a 1999 update featuring high-resolution graphics,
  vibration feedback and 60 frames per second racing. The bonus disc also contains
  playable demos of both Klonoa: Door to Phantomile and Tekken 3, movies of
  Namco's Guncon games and a video preview of Ace Combat 3.
  .
  Features\n
  * Features 45 cars and eight different courses\n

publisher: Agetec
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  In RPG Maker, players with absolutely no programming experience or prior
  game-production skills can make their own role-playing quests and save them to
  the PlayStation memory card for themselves or a friend to enjoy. The world
  creation in the game is tile-based, and the entire game is done in the 2D style
  of 16-bit era RPGs. Players can create characters, towns, dungeons and script
  action to move along at a certain pace. They will place treasures, enter
  dialogue and create events that are triggered by certain actions within the game
  world.
  .
  Although players can create nearly anything they like with the game, it must be
  more or less contained in a fantasy theme, as the only graphics available adhere
  to that specific genre. Within that genre, however, the possibilities are
  varied, and you can make your new RPG a massive epic or a short jaunt. It can be
  utterly serious or laced with juvenile humor. Also contained within RPG Maker is
  a mode called Anime Maker, where those with the desire can create 2D pictures
  and animate them accordingly.

game: Rakugaki Showtime (Japan)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Rakugaki Showtime (Japan)/Rakugaki Showtime (Japan).json
developer: Treasure
publisher: Enix
genre: Fighting
description:
  Rakugaki Showtime is a game along the same vein as Poitter's Point (Also known
  as Poy Poy )where in you try to defeat the opponents by throwing things at them.
  .
  STORY:\n
  Welcome to the world of Rakugaki. An imaginary game world, created entirely by
  the pencil drawings of the "God Hand". The characters who inhabit this world
  were created by the God Hand in the same way... Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitanand
  Tsubohachi; the four members of the "Heroes Team", and Daddy; who commands the
  mysterious enemy character army.
  .
  Called the "Heroes and Enemies", they are all controlled by their master, and
  follow their predetermined (created?) fate. Today a battle to the end unfolds...
  .
  GAMEPLAY:\n
  Rakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight
  against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly
  consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple
  as "pick up, aim & throw". In Rakugaki Showtime different "drives" can be placed
  on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the
  direction towards the target will cause a "Forward Drive Throw", which is like a
  faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target
  will cause you to do a "Backward Drive Throw", which will cause your character
  to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage.
  .
  By performing a "Counter", you are able to block most items thrown at you. If
  your timing is off, the Item will just bounce off you and drop down. But if you
  "Counter" just before the item hits you, your character will perform a "Donpisha
  Counter" (Donpisha means to trigger immediately), which causes the item to be
  reflected back at the original thrower.
  .
  One of the more important items in the game is a Smiley Ball. Unlike all other
  items, Smiley Balls will not be destroyed after use. Instead, every impact will
  slowly make the Smiley Ball go from yellow to magenta, from happy to angry.
  After it gets very angry, a sound clip of "halleluja" will play and the Smiley
  will be engulfed in flashing white light... it has become a Super Smiley. When
  you pick up a Super Smiley, you will not throw it. Instead, your rakugaki will
  unleash their "Super Smiley Attack", which in most cases is devestating. Also,
  your fighter may be able to use different Super Smiley Attack's by applying
  different drives, these are called Forward Super Smileys and the Backward Drive
  Super Smileys.
  .
  Like every other fighting game that has ever existed, you can execute Special
  Moves. These usually consist of very basic button commands involving the
  directional buttons and generally the Circle button. Some characters have a
  whole arsenal of Special Moves, others only have only a handful.
  .
  Around the stages are "Item Points", these are where the God Hand will draw the
  Items to be used in battle. You can make your character move to these points
  quickly by performing a "Homing Dash". To do this, jump, hold the direction you
  want to go and then hit the jump button again. You will fly over to the point
  you indicated. As well as item points, you can use a "Homing Dash" to quickly
  fly over to Smiley Balls, this is EXTREMELY helpful. You are also able to "Chain
  Homing Dashes", to do this, just hold the jump button down after doing a Homing
  Dash, and tap the direction of another item point before you land. You can
  cancel Homing Dashes mid-flight by pressing the Circle Button.
  .
  GAME MODES:\n
  - Normal Mode: In this mode, you battle enemies in set stages. The difficulty
  differs depending on your performance, where doing badly (i.e. losing two times
  in arow) nets you crappy characters (e.g. Zacko) whereas doing well rewards
  youwith really good characters. At first you will only be able to play as
  Yukiwo, Sasami, Pitan and Tsubohachi, but everytime you complete the game you
  will unlock another character. There are 12 stages you must battle through,
  ending with a final rumble against the God Hand.\n
  - Versus Mode: In versus mode, you can battle to other three players or computer
  rtvals.\n
  - Training Mode: Here you select a character to fight against a Zacko who has an
  absurd amount of life and hardly enough brain cells to fill a pore on the human
  face. This isgood to test out damage for the different moves of your character.
  The missions are as follows: 1) Use the Smiley Ball 2) Use Items 3) Test your
  skills.
  .
  CHARACTERS:\n
  - Yukiwo: Yukiwo is the standard well-rounded protagonist. He has an above
  averageamount of health, at 3928 HP. His running speed is Fairly Fast, and his
  Homing Dash speed is pretty Average.\n
  - Sasami: Sasami is a very agile fighter.she's skilled in the Kung Fu Arts. Both
  her running and Homing Dash speeds are Fast, which will allow her to run rings
  against most of the opposition. She is fairly "light-weight" though, only having
  2333 HP. She only has a couple of Special Moves, and they are all pretty weak.\n
  - Pitan: Pitan is a cute mischievous monk, who speaks in Kansai Ben.. He has
  3001 HP, his running speed is Fast,and his Homing Dash speed is Fairly Fast.
  Apart from being speedy, Pitan's greatest advantage over the others are his
  highly useful Super Smiley Attacks.\n
  - Tsubohachi: Tsubohachi is Pitan's unruly drunk of a father. He is constantly
  referred to as "OYAJI", which is somewhat Japanese slang for "My Old Man",
  "Geezer", etc. Tsubohachi is one of the most enjoyable characters to play as.
  Whilst your controlling him, he won'tfollow your commands 100% correctly, which
  gives you the feeling of playing as a drunk. It's a brilliant touch to this
  character. Tsubohachi has a very decent amount of health, at 4802 HP, and his
  running and Homing Dash speed are both very random. Relying on whether your
  pushing against or with the way he's staggering.

genre: Platform
description:
  Rayman is a side-scrolling platform game starring a whimsical character with
  fists instead of arms and feet instead of legs. Rayman embarks on strange quest
  to save the Great Protoon and his tiny followers from the evil Mister Dark.
  Since the land relies on the Great Protoon to maintain balance and harmony, the
  planet is now in chaos. Guide Rayman across 70 cartoon-like levels while facing
  over 50 bizarre baddies trying to put the limbless hero out of commission.
  .
  Along the way, you must attempt to free singing creatures called Electoons from
  their cages. Don't expect a walk in the park, however. The enemies have been
  designed to learn your playing style in order to defeat you. Acquire new moves
  and abilities as you progress through the world, and return to earlier levels to
  find hidden secrets. Rayman offers CD-quality sound effects and music, vibrant
  vistas featuring 65,000 colors, and four layers of independently scrolling
  backdrops. A memory card with two blocks of free space is required to save
  progress.
  .
  Features:\n
  * Help Rayman rescue the Electoons\n
  * Includes 70 levels and more than 50 characters\n
  * Graphics feature 65,000 colors and independently scrolling backgrounds
  .
  STORY:\n
  Embark on a strange quest to save a world's Great Protoon and rescue little
  Electroons from imprisonment. You see, the world of Rayman relies on the Great
  Protoon to maintain balance and harmony for every living creature.
  .
  The problem is that the evil Mister Dark has decided to capture him (it?) to
  throw the planet into chaos. This is where you come in! Guide Rayman through 70
  cartoon-like, side-scrolling levels facing over fifty bizarre characters trying
  to put you out of commission.
  .
  Along the way, free the Electroons who have been forced into cages by the
  baddies. Don't expect a walk in the park, however. The enemies will actually
  learn your playing style in order to defeat you! Acquire new moves and abilities
  as you progress through the world and return to earlier levels to find hidden
  secrets. Rayman also features CD-quality sound effects and music, 65,000 colors,
  plus four layers of independently scrolling backdrops to mesmerize you while
  playing. Don't just stand there gawking, the Great Protoon awaits!
  .
  GAMEPLAY:\n
  The Rayman character is perfect for little children, though this game is easily
  difficult enough for adults. 60 levels for Rayman to conquer and none of them is
  easy, not even the first levels, because you have to get used to controlling
  Rayman.
  .
  Sometimes the difficulty can be quite annoying, but luckily, if you get by a
  clown holding a camera and let him take your picture, you can save your progress
  in a level. On the world map there's also points where you can save after
  completing a level, it doesn't take much space in you system memory. A problem
  is, that when you completed all levels in the game, you still haven't beaten
  mister Dark.
  .
  To get to this final level you must find each of the six cages of Electoons in
  each of the 60 levels. So if you can't find one cage, completing the game is
  impossible. A very good thing in the game is that the further you get in the
  game, the more abilities you get. For example, Rayman can hang on an edge,
  helicopter, use his glove to beat enemies, that sort of thing.

genre: Action;Horror
description:
  Resident Evil: Director's Cut is a reissue of the original Resident Evil. Unlike
  Resident Evil for the GameCube, it is not a remake of the original game,
  instead, it is more of a slight remix.
  .
  There are three gameplay modes available. "Original" contains the original game
  with no changes or additions. "Beginner" features double the amount of
  ammunition and save ribbons, plus increased health for the player, increased
  damage for their weapons, and an auto-target feature.
  .
  "Arrange" mode is the "Director's Cut" version of the original. The default
  outfits for Jill, Chris, and Rebecca are changed, new camera angles are
  introduced, and the placement of key items is changed. Most of these changes are
  designed to play against the expectations of veteran players of the first
  Resident Evil - so zombie dogs may smash through new windows, or keys will not
  be where they were, forcing players to hunt for them anew. The default Beretta
  pistol is also changed to a chromed version with a randomized chance to kill
  standard zombies in one shot.
  .
  The original release of the Director's Cut advertised an uncut version of the
  opening cinema, in full color, and never-before seen. Notable aspects of this
  video include shots of a corpse with bites taken out of the face, close-ups of
  zombie dogs bleeding when shot, and graphic quick-cuts of Joseph being bitten by
  these dogs. Chris is also shown smoking in his introduction, which was cut from
  Western releases. However, only the French and German releases contained this
  footage. U.S. and UK versions retained the censored black-and-white video
  shipped with the original release. This has never been corrected, either in the
  Greatest Hits reissue, or with the PSOne Classics downloads on the Playstation
  Network.
  .
  The original issue of the Director's Cut contained a demo of Resident Evil 2 on
  a second disc. The "Greatest Hits" re-release added Dual Shock support for the
  controller (left "movement" stick only).

  A third version for the PlayStation, Dual Shock Ver, co-produced by Keiji
  Inafune, was released in August 1998. It features support for the DualShock
  controller's analog controls and vibration functions, as well as a new symphonic
  soundtrack, replacing the original soundtrack by Makoto Tomozawa, Koichi Hiroki,
  and Masami Ueda. The symphonic music was credited to composer Mamoru
  Samuragochi, Although he admitted in 2014 that he directed his orchestrator
  Takashi Niigaki to ghostwrite the new soundtrack. The Japanese Dual Shock Ver.
  came packaged with a bonus disc that contained downloadable save data, footage
  of the unused Japanese dubbed versions of the live-action cutscenes, along with
  brief gameplay footage of the canceled original version of Resident Evil 2.
  .
  In North America, Resident Evil: Director's Cut Dual Shock Ver. was later
  released as a downloadable game available from the PlayStation Network. Although
  the game is advertised with the original Director's Cut box art. In Japan and
  Europe, the original Director's Cut was instead made available from the
  PlayStation Network.

game: Resident Evil - Survivor (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation/Resident Evil - Survivor (USA)/Resident Evil - Survivor (USA).json
developer: Capcom
publisher: Capcom
genre: Shooter
description:
  The player takes control of an amnesiac protagonist, struggling desperately
  against overwhelming odds to stay alive and uncover his identity. Survivor's
  gameplay is a combination of first-person shooter and arcade-style light gun
  game. The player views the environment from the perspective of the character
  (first person view) and moves the character through the environment with the
  controller. At the same time, if the player wishes to attack an enemy or destroy
  an object, they press a button which allows them to control a crosshair on the
  screen. This crosshair can be moved to any location within the main character's
  line of sight. Using the G-Con 45, players move around by shooting off screen to
  move and the side buttons to turn, and point at the screen to shoot enemies.\n
  The game borrows its enemies from Resident Evil 2, featuring the zombie models
  from that game, as well as creatures such as Lickers, the Ivy plants, Moth
  Giants and Tyrants. In addition, Survivor also reintroduces the original Hunters
  from the first Resident Evil and features two new enemies in the form of the
  Umbrella Trashsweeper unit â soldiers armed with machine guns â and the Hypnos
  T-Type, a new Tyrant model that evolves into different forms. The player's
  arsenal consists almost entirely of pistols, such as the Glock 17 and the CZ75.
  As the protagonist progresses through the game, the player receives larger
  weapons to aid in defending against ever more dangerous opposition while they
  make their way through Umbrella's ruined city and shadowy research labs. The
  game features branching paths that allow the player to determine how the story
  will unfold and whom they will meet along the way.

  The game is set two months after the events of the first Resident Evil, in the
  Midwestern American mountain community of Raccoon City. Nearly all of its
  citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new
  type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company
  Umbrella. The game's two protagonists are Leon S. Kennedy, a rookie police
  officer on his first day in the local force, and Claire Redfield, a college
  student looking for her brother Chris. Having just arrived in the city, Leon and
  Claire make their way to the Raccoon Police Department, seeking protection from
  the mutated population. There, they discover that most of the policemen have
  been killed already, and that Chris has left town to investigate the Umbrella
  headquarters in Europe. With no remaining motivation to stay, the two
  protagonists split up to look for other survivors and flee the city. While
  searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl named Sherry, who is
  on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters Ada Wong, who claims to
  be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.

  After the success of Resident Evil, development on Resident Evil 2 began.
  Trailers and footage of the game's development were released on a periodic
  basis until what is now known as the "1.5 build" was cancelled altogether in
  favor of a new build of the game, delaying the release date. Sometime after
  this, the first Resident Evil was given an updated release with new gameplay
  elements and exclusive features, known as the Resident Evil: Director's Cut.
  To give players a taste of what would come the following year, Director's
  Cut came bundled with the first publicly available demo of Resident Evil 2.
  .
  The first build of this demo was released in Japan. The Trial Edition has a
  number of differences from other versions, utilizing more prototype content.
  The second build of the game that was released internationally, the Preview,
  is nearly identical to its Japanese counterpart. This is the earliest
  playable build of the retail version of Resident Evil 2.
  .
  Sometime later in the following year, a second version of the Preview demo
  was released on several demo compilation discs. This demo is based on the
  retail version of the game, offering very few differences.

  After its initial release for the PlayStation in January 1998, Resident Evil 2
  was reissued and ported to other systems, often gaining new features in the
  process. The first re-release was the Dual Shock Ver., which incorporated
  support for the vibration and analog control functions of the PlayStation's
  DualShock controller. Other additions include a new unlockable minigame called
  "Extreme Battle", and a "Rookie" mode that enables the player to start the main
  story with a powerful weapon that features infinite ammunition. The Japanese
  release of the Dual Shock Ver. contained a "U.S.A. Version" mode based on the
  difficulty level of Resident Evil 2's Western versions.
  .
  The Dual Shock Ver. served as the basis for the majority of ports, such as the
  Windows 9x-based PC-CD version Resident Evil 2 Platinum. Aside from retaining
  all previously added features, the PC version can be run in higher resolutions.
  A "Data Gallery" was added to the main menu, allowing the player to view movies,
  rough sketches, illustrations and 3D models. In February 2006, a
  Japan-exclusive, Windows XP-compatible PC-DVD re-release was published.
  Developed by Sourcenext, it included high-quality FMVs encoded at a resolution
  of 640Ã480 pixels. The Dreamcast version keeps the additions from the original
  PC release, and incorporates real-time display of the character's condition on
  the Visual Memory Unit peripheral. The Japanese edition of the Dreamcast port
  was given the subtitle Value Plus and came with a playable demo of Resident Evil
  â Code: Veronica. An unmodified port of the Dual Shock Ver. was released for the
  GameCube. The initial PlayStation version was re-released on the Japanese
  PlayStation Network in 2007, while the service's North American counterpart
  received the Dual Shock Ver. two years later.

  The year is 2042 AD and all forms of physical violence against organic lifeforms

  Large corporations can acquire prestige and profit by developing successful
  robots and weapons. Robots are victorious in battle if they are still functional
  after defeating their opponent. Upon defeating their opponent they may take
  their opponents' arms and use them to upgrade themself.
  .
  The first order of business for the player is to create their own robot. This
  requires them to select a body, face, base, weapon arms, and a name. Up to ten
  custom robots may be saved at one time. Arms are rated in five categories:
  power, speed, defense, type, and skill. Different types of arms are:
  punch/middle or punch/big punch, hammer/fire or punch/boomerang, sword/axe/kama,
  lance/squid/spear, small gun/bow gun/laser/cannon, sucker/hand, shield A or
  B/buckler/talon, and heavy hammer/mace.
  .
  Battles can be fought against the computer, against another player, or in
  training mode. For computer battles players can challenge any robot ranked under
  them or any robot up to 20 ranks above them. The main objective is to eventually
  reach the number one ranking. Victories against robots ranked higher than them
  will gain players points and increase their rank. While defeating robots ranked
  below them won't gain a player a higher rank, it will help to gain experience
  and receive new weapon arms.

  The battles takes place in the Coliseum. The Coliseum consists of a number of
  rooms each hosting an enemy robot that the player has to defeat to unlock more
  rooms. Defeating an enemy can also grant the player new body parts as well as
  experience and skill points. The player can move around his robot from a third
  person perspective and launch different attacks such as jabs, straight, hook and
  upper attacks. With good timing it's also possible to link attacks together. A
  special attack can be executed when the SP gauge is full. There's also a guard
  impact command which allows the player to repel the enemy attack. The player has

  Mega Man 3 is a traditional side-scrolling platformer: you jump from brick to
  brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all

  a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely
  walking.
  .
  Rush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when
  you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top
  of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to
  turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and
  he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like
  the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the
  water (you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover
  beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities
  function just like boss weapons.
  .
  When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least
  a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single
  power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but
  superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter.
  There are eight of these, corresponding to the eight main levels, even though
  there are twenty-one levels in the entire game.
  .
  Enemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also
  collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your
  health. You start the game with three lives. Other features include Surprise
  Boxes lying around for you to find. There are infinite continues and a password
  feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.

  North America and in November 1993 in Europe.
  .
  The plot takes place after the fourth defeat of the evil Dr. Wily at the hands
  of the heroic robot Mega Man in the year 20XX. Proto Man uncharacteristically
  leads a group of menacing robots in attacks on the world and kidnaps his own
  creator Dr. Light, leaving Mega Man little choice but to take up arms in a fight
  against his once trusted brother. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical
  style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the
  series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, which the player can use as a
  weapon once a series of eight collectable letters are found.
  .
  Mega Man 5 was met with an average to fairly positive critical reception, with
  the one major complaint being its lack of originality in either its plot or
  gameplay. Like other NES games in the series, Mega Man 5 has been re-released in
  Japan on the PlayStation and mobile phones and in North America as part of the
  Mega Man Anniversary Collection.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  SaGa Frontier is a Sony PlayStation role-playing game by Square, released in
  Japan on July 11, 1997. The game was later published by Sony Computer
  Entertainment (SCEA) in North America on March 25, 1998. It is the seventh game
  in the SaGa series and the first to be released on the PlayStation. The game was
  directed and produced by Akitoshi Kawazu with aid from chief planner Koichi
  Ishii and musical composer Kenji Ito.
  .
  When the game was re-issued in Japan in 2000 as part of the Square Millennium
  Collection, it included a collectible teacup set and a tee-shirt depicting the
  character Blue.
  .
  The plot of SaGa Frontier takes place in a science fiction/fantasy universe
  called the Regions, a group of worlds with varying degrees of culture, unique
  races, technology, and magic. The game allows the player to follow the exploits
  of one of seven protagonists, each with his or her own storyline and goal. The
  game's Free Scenario System offers a large amount of non-linear gameplay,
  allowing the player to freely travel between many of the Regions, interact with
  other characters, and take part in turn-based combat.
  .
  The basic concept of SaGa Frontier is based on its Free Scenario System, in
  which one can play as any of seven different protagonists, all of whom exist in
  the same setting: a solar system known as The Regions, a group of planets, each
  with its own culture, game-level of technology, and form of magic.
  .
  STORY:\n
  The player can choose any one of seven main characters to play as, each with
  their own storyline.
  .
  - Asellus, formerly a human girl, was run over by a carriage and given a blood
  transfusion by the Mystic Lord Orlouge. Chosen as the Charm Lord's heir, she is
  despised by human and mystic alike due to her status as the only half-Mystic in
  existence. She escapes Orlouge's castle with the help of the Princess White
  Rose. Asellus and White Rose remain on the run from Orlouge's many servants, but
  after White Rose sacrifices herself to save Asellus's life and freedom, Asellus
  decides to return and defeat Orlouge, to end the struggle once and for all.
  Depending on the actions the player does, there are three endings, in which she
  end live on as a human, half Mystic, or complete Mystic.
  .
  - Blue is a young mage fresh out of magic school. His quest is to collect the
  "Gift" for as many magics as possible. After that he is destined to fight his
  twin Rouge who has gained the opposite magics. Whichever brother survives
  obtains the other's magic and receives the sacred "Life" magic. It is revealed
  they were created artificially to produce the only wizard who could master all
  magical powers, even the conflicting pairs, and the duel is a mere formality to
  establish the dominant persona. Afterwards, Blue/Rouge descends into Hell to
  fight the demons who attacked his home.
  .
  - Emelia is a blonde ex-con and secret agent formerly working as a model. Her
  story begins when her fiance Ren was murdered by a mysterious villain known as
  the "Joker". Wrongfully accused of the crime, she was sentenced to imprisonment
  in Despair, where she met Annie and Liza. With their help, they complete a
  competition the warden created to receive a full pardon for their crimes. After
  their escape, Emelia was recruited by the two to join the secret organization
  Gradius, which was also hunting for the "Joker".
  .
  - Lute is a carefree bard whose mother kicked him out of the house until Lute
  found a decent job. He stumbles face-first into a plot involving Trinity general
  Mondo and resistance leader Captain Hamilton, and the legacy of Lute's deceased
  father, who was betrayed and killed by Mondo.
  .
  - Red is a teenage boy whose family is destroyed by the criminal syndicate
  called Black X. After being rescued from the same fate by the masked superhero
  named Alkarl, he is granted the identity of the superhero Alkaiser. After
  destroying several Black X bases and their main stronghold, Red stands at his
  father's grave, and Alkarl appears to take Red's powers away, making him a
  normal man again. It turns out that Alkarl was Red's father's friend, Hawk, and
  Red will not be able to live a "normal" life for long.
  .
  - Riki (Known as Coon in the Japanese release) is a Lummox, a fox-like creature,
  and one of the last remaining inhabitants of the mysterious world, Margmel.
  Determined to save his homeworld, he seeks the Rings of Margmel. In his search,
  he starts out in Scrap, where he finds the researcher Mei-ling. Riki's quest
  takes him around the regions to gather the Rings until he comes face to face
  with Virgil, a Mystic Lord. Following the battle, Riki returns home to attempt
  to restore Margmel, but faces Mei-Ling, who is under the control of the Rings.
  .
  - T260G is an ancient Mec, a model constructed from junk parts, awakened in
  modern times. Originally part of a combat ship with a mission against
  RB3[clarification needed], it lost its memory when it crashed into Junk. With
  help of Leonard, a human who transferred his memories into a Mec, and Gen, a
  master swordsman, it recovers its memory and finishes the job.

  his mother and his conquering Wide, Gustave hears of the death of his father and
  heads to the Finney kingdom to take the throne. He gives the throne to his
  brother Phillipe. Gustave dies at the age of 49 in one of his forts.

game: Saiyuki - Journey West (USA)

developer: Koei
publisher: Koei Co., Ltd.
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  Saiyuki: Journey West is a title that weaves the tale of a fantastic quest
  featuring tactical medieval combat between people and creatures with a host of
  bizarre powers. Saiyuki: Journey West is based on one of the most famous Chinese
  folk tales; the journey of the monk Sanzo to India and back from his native
  land. Sanzo has the power to call forth powerful guardians to aid him in times
  of need, and as his quest progresses, so will the strength of his summoning.
  Along the way he encounters a whole host of characters and situations, and most
  of the allies he meets will have the peculiar power to mutate into monstrous
  were-creatures that possess enhanced powers.
  .
  Saiyuki is a tactical/strategy RPG that centers around an adolescent named Sanzo
  or Genjo, depending on whether players should choose the character to be male or
  female. The main character was found in a basket floating down a river in a way
  not unlike the Holy Bible's Moses, then adopted by some monks in China. The
  story kicks off when a goddess named Lady Kannon appears to Sanzo/Genjo and
  tells him/her to deliver a thunder staff to a sacred temple in India. Kannon
  then provides a staff to to the hero, the monks bid him you farewell and good
  luck, and then players take off for a journey West.
  .
  Players will journey as Sanzo or Genjo, taking on an expanding cast of
  characters to help win the day. The path through the game is very linear,
  comparable to Final Fantasy Tactics, and focuses on squad combat. All of the
  player-controlled characters aside from Sanzo have alternate were-forms they can
  slip in and out of at any given point in the fight. Yet finding the right time
  to alter one's form is the key to the battle, since transitions can take quite a
  bit out of the individual and can only occur once during a single combat.
  .
  Although Saiyuki: Journey West does rely on skill management in relation to the
  were-forms and Sanzo's guardian magic, the complexities of similar tactical
  combat games have been put aside. But the key to this game is the fighting. Most
  time on the battlefield is spent attempting to correctly place troops in order
  to get a jump on your enemies. Each character is attuned to a certain element,
  as are the enemies. A good deal of the game's strategy comes in finding which
  element is more powerful against which, and then exploiting the strengths and
  weaknesses of the opponents' elemental stature.

description:
  Stinger returned home one morning after a night out of town to a horrible
  surprise. A mysterious force had destroyed his coastal hometown, leaving few
  survivors. Unable to even determine the remains of his own house, the young man
  was now an orphan. Upon meeting a mystic named Windleaf, the two decided to
  embark upon a journey to find out what happened.
  .
  Their adventure in Shadow Madness will span across the entire fantastic world of
  Arkose, even to the unexplored area known as Wyldern. Meeting up with four other
  unique warriors along the way (the droid-like Harv-5, a magical floating head
  named Xero Von Moon, a cyborg-like Gadgeteer called Clemett and Wyldern-native
  Jirina), the group strives to seek out and destroy the source of Arkose's
  destruction.
  .
  In classic RPG style, they'll confront evil minions through random encounters,
  avoidable if the party hides quickly enough upon hearing the wild sounds of the
  enemy. After each successful encounter, the party is rewarded with experience
  points, often accompanied by gold and items useful to its journey. Once
  characters have enough experience points, they advance in level, increasing such
  abilities as attack strength, defense, agility (ability to evade attacks),
  prowess (ability to strike hits) and speed (how often they can attack).

  Marvel Comics' friendly neighborhood wall-crawler makes his 3D debut with
  Spider-Man for the PlayStation. Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker
  (a.ka. Spider-Man) has super-human strength, the reflexes and agility of a
  spider, the ability to stick to walls and most other surfaces and Spider-Sense,
  which is an internal sensor that warns him of pending danger. He used his
  scientific skills to formulate a webbing substance, which he shoots from a
  device affixed to his wrists.
  .
  In this game, patterned closely after the comics, Peter Parker was attending a
  science exposition given by the now benevolent Dr. Otto Octavius (formerly known
  as Dr. Octopus) when all hell broke loose. Someone dressed in a Spider-Man
  costume stormed the building, took out the guards and stole the doctor's new
  technology. Now, the police and everyone in New York City assume the superhero
  is a thieving swine.
  .
  Adding to the confusion is Eddie Brock, the human half of the symbiotic
  supervillain named Venom; his attendance at the exposition is baffling. As
  Spider-Man, you must get to the bottom of the mysterious happenings, clear your
  name and make New York City safe (relatively speaking) once again.
  .
  You control the arachnid superhero as he swings through the city, going in and
  on top of buildings and pummeling bad guys and other supervillians. Just like
  Spider-Man's comic book crusades, you can run, jump, punch, kick, stick to
  surfaces and shoot webs. Your webs enable you to swing through the city and
  yank, pull and trap enemies; you can also use the webbing to create spiked
  gloves, projectiles and a shield dome. Additionally, you can use combinations of
  punching, kicking and webbing for a more fierce and effective attack.
  .
  Missions in Spider-Man include infiltrating a bank for a search-and-rescue,
  saving Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's bacon from the deadly Scorpion,
  chasing Venom (who has kidnapped your girl) through the city and dodging bullets
  from well-intentioned police. You'll run across fellow superheroes such as Black
  Cat, Captain America and Daredevil and battle Marvel villains such as Mysterio,
  Rhino and Carnage. There are eight levels in all. Keep an eye out for the
  Fantastic Four headquarters, which shares the city skyline with such familiar
  structures as the Statue of Liberty.
  .
  Throughout the game, you can pick up web and health cartridges and armor. Helper
  icons appear as aids for less experienced players. Walking into one of these
  will give you helpful information such as how to use your webbing and how to
  solve certain puzzles. You can also find special alternative costumes that will
  help you overcome difficult adversaries. A Spider-Compass positioned at the
  bottom right of the screen will help you find your way through certain sections
  of the various levels, and Spider-Sense, issued forth via vibration function on
  the controller, emits when danger is nearby.
  .
  If you're not ready for the demands of being a professional superhero, you can
  enter a Practice mode that offers the following training sessions: Time Attack,
  Survival Mode, Speed Training, Target Practice and Item Collection. In the
  standard game, you can choose from four skill levels -- Kid, Easy, Normal and
  Hard.
  .
  Spider-Man includes a number of extras that you can unlock throughout the game
  such as the ability to watch mini-movies and view a character gallery. You can
  also collect comic book icons that reveal actual comic book covers in reference
  to historic events in Spider-Man's crime fighting career. Stan Lee, co-creator
  of Spider-Man, narrates the action, and Rino Romano, voice of the cartoon
  Spider-Man, reprises his vocal role as the wisecracking web-slinger.

  will burst. When all petals burst, you've defeated the level. Arcade mode is one
  of three separate ways to play Spin Jam. In it, you must challenge your skills
  in 100 levels. Each level will get more difficult, and you'll discover more
  twists and turns as you advance.
  .
  Battle mode lets you and a friend compete in a head-to-head match. The winner is
  the first to explode their screen's petals. Story mode is like a single-player
  version of the Battle mode. You'll progress through each character's series of
  "planets" to get a shot at defeating an evil dictator named Moolamb. Eight
  characters are initially available, with more waiting to be unlocked. Use
  special bubbles as power-ups to help you clear each color-changing petal.

genre: Role-Playing
description:
  The game gives the player the choice of playing as Rena or Claude, with the
  journey evolving and ending differently depending on the choices one makes.
  .
  Star Ocean: The Second Story is a world of magic, science, space travel and
  deadly demons! Enter a world where love knows no bounds, the evil is neverending
  and good can overcome all if the heart is just and true. Featuring three battle
  modes, the ability to master skills to create items and an emotional level for
  each of the characters, Enix has pulled out all the stops in their latest (and
  first) title to be brought to the North American PlayStation.
  .
  Star Ocean: The Second Story takes place twenty years after the original game,
  Star Ocean. Roughly the first half of the plot of the game takes place on the
  planet Expel, an underdeveloped planet on the verge of its industrial age. On
  Expel kings still rule over great kingdoms, swords and sorcery dominate the
  battlefield, and sailing ships are still made from wood. According to a
  Federation law, named the Undeveloped Planet Protection Treaty, a planet with
  such a level of civilization may not be directly contacted under any but the
  most dire circumstancesâand even then, contact must be minimal and secretive.
  This law is reminiscent of Star Trek's Prime Directive.

description:
  Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the
  Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility,
  he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base.
  This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various
  iterations of his "Dark Troopers" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and
  firepower to turn the tide of the war.
  .
  Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game
  marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead
  of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own
  internal "Jedi" engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar
  tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited
  support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D
  models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's
  ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.

  It's the year 2069 and the Earth is under attack. Prior to landing, aliens
  shower the world with thousands of pods, unleashing a force so destructive that
  all of Earth's armies are powerless to stop it. A legion of teaming metallic
  tendrils bursts from the pods, infecting nearly every living life form,
  including humans, animals, plants, and insects, transforming them into mindless
  killing machines. Dwindling in numbers by the minute, the Earth and all of her
  citizens are quickly becoming ripe for invasion. During the infestation, Miranda
  gets partially infected by the tendrils, which turn her body into a powerful
  weapon but leave her with her basic human instincts intact. With guidance from
  her scientist father Dr. Bowen, Miranda is the only one powerful enough to save
  the world.
  .
  In Steel Harbinger, a darkly futuristic running, jumping, 3-D shoot-'em-up, you
  must guide Miranda through certain areas of Kansas, Las Vegas, San Francisco,
  Houston, Cape Canaveral, Washington, the Antarctic, an alien planetoid, and the
  Moon. In each level you'll have specific missions to accomplish such as killing
  aliens, finding special weapons, saving humans, opening secret rooms, activating
  defense facilities, and destroying key enemy sites. You can teleport between
  locations by finding teleport cards and telepads. Access to specific buildings
  and other restricted areas can be gained with pass cards that you will find
  hidden throughout the levels. In addition to the standard action, you can also
  commandeer trucks, hovercraft, floating discs, and tanks.

  Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up

  opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next
  to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming
  a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than
  breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate

  Chester, who relied on brute force in the Super Famicom version, was given nine
  TP-consuming moves, which carried over into future versions. Also carried over
  from Tales of Destiny was the voice-acted face chats (skits), but now the user
  simply needs to push select on the world map to see them, rather than stand
  still for awhile on the world map as in ToD. In addition, it gave birth to many

  Technomage is a video game released by German game developer Sunflowers.
  Technomage was only released in PAL territories.
  .
  The player character, Melvin, must save the world of Gothos from destruction.
  The people of Gothos are split into two types, the magic using Dreamers, and the
  technological Steamers. Melvin is half Dreamer, half Steamer. Melvin starts in
  his hometown of Dreamertown, when it is attacked by monsters. He is blamed, and
  taken to trial to be exiled. His uncle then teaches you the "basics", pending
  your exile. This section serves as the tutorial stage. After this you leave
  Dreamertown and head to Steamertown, on your adventure to find your father.
  .
  TechnoMage: Return of Eternity is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of
  adventure, role-playing, and action-based combat. Many of the game's missions
  involve peaceful wandering through the environments, talking to characters, and
  performing tasks that often involve solving puzzles of various kinds, in an
  adventure-like fashion. RPG elements are present in experience points which the
  hero receives form eliminating enemies and completing quests.
  .
  STORY:\n
  After passing Steamertown, Melvin enters a huge underground labyrinth called
  "The Hive", where his father vanished during an expedition. The Hive is a vast
  network built by the former rulers of Gothos. It contains grave complexes,
  libraries and laboratories; Melvin finds the first crystal of eternity there.
  When he leaves the Hive, he steps into the Great Forest, the realm of the
  fairies. They suffer from goblin uproars which are stopped by Melvin who then
  joins a pair of Shach traders on their journey to the canyon. Here, Melvin
  encounters Dagomar for the first time, the last survivor of the former rulers of
  Gothos. He acts as Melvin's mentor and guide. Also, Melvin befriends Talis, a
  girl who lives in exile because she also is half Dreamer, half Steamer.
  .
  After clearing the canyon's mines, they travel to the tower, the former rulers'
  fortress of knowledge, which is now haunted by an undead dragon. As Melvin kills
  the dragon, another dragon is freed who takes Melvin to the volcano, which is
  where the Shach traders live. In the deeper levels of the volcano's caves,
  Melvin discovers more artifacts and buildings from the former rulers, as well as
  a map which leads him, talis and the dragon to the ancient ruins of the former
  capital of Gothos. Here, Dagomar drops his disguise and Melvin has to find out
  that he is Ramogad, the traitor who led to the downfall of the former rulers.
  After a big fight against Ramogad, Melvin uses the crystals of eternity found in
  the different regions of Gothos to reactivate both a stasis trap to stop Ramogad
  and a barrier device which uses a magic liquid to shield Gothos from the demon
  realms below. Talis then helps Melvin to escape the collapsing ruins and they
  fly across the ocean towards the sun.

  also has the ability to remember your high-scores, unlike the original Game Boy
  game. Puzzle Mode is a twist on the classic gameplay that provides a new
  scenario. Also included is an editor for making Puzzle levels, and Link
  capability for going head-to-head with another player in either game mode. The
  Console Versions also have a two player Versus Mode which is essentially puzzle
  mode with two players racing for the finish line.
  .
  PUZZLE MODE:\n
  The biggest addition to Tetris Plus is the Puzzle Mode. The player starts by
  choosing any of four world locations: Maya, Knossos, Egypt, or Angkor Wat. The
  final area, Atlantis, is unlocked by successfully completing the other four
  stages (in any order). Each of the four locations has a different level set.
  Once the game starts, the player is presented with a cluster of pre-placed
  bricks, and the professor enters the play-area through a disappearing gate. The
  objective is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks
  and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and crushes
  him.
  .
  The player's goal is to guide this archaeologist to the bottom as fast as
  possible. Two blocks wide and tall, he will aimlessly walk forward until he
  bumps into a block, after which he turns around and walks the other way. If he
  comes across a gap that is large enough for him to fit through, he will fall
  down onto the blocks below him. Conversely, if blocks are placed on top of him,
  he will climb up them until he reaches the top. As one could guess, if these
  blocks lead too closely to the spikes, the professor will die.
  .
  Upon starting the level, the spiked ceiling will start at the top of the
  play-area. About once every eighteen seconds, it will move down one row, slowly
  taking away workable space. The player is able to make the ceiling go back up,
  however, if they can clear three or four rows at once. The ceiling will also
  destroy any placed blocks that are in its way. This can be used as a garbage
  disposal, by having it remove any unwanted pieces until the piece the player
  wants shows up.

  In Tomb Raider, the player controls the female archaeologist Lara Croft, in
  search for the three mysterious Scion artefacts across the world. The game is
  presented in third person perspective. Lara is always visible and the camera
  follows the action from behind or over her shoulder. The world she inhabits is
  fully drawn in three dimensions and characterized by its cubic nature. Ledges,
  walls and ceilings mostly sit at 90 degrees to each other, but sometimes feature
  sloping planes.\n
  The object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other
  locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill
  dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving
  puzzles to gain access to an ultimate prize, usually a powerful artefact.
  Gunplay is restricted to the killing of various animals that appear throughout
  each stage, although occasionally Lara may be faced with a human opponent.
  Instead the emphasis lies on solving puzzles and performing trick jumps to
  complete each level.

description:
  In the Prologue, millions of years ago, a meteor struck the then tropical
  environments of Antarctica. It was first discovered by a tribe of ancient
  Polynesians who settled there and constructed a city in the meteorite crater.
  They worshipped the immense supernatural powers it appeared to hold, fashioning
  four artefacts out of the meteorite's core material (which become the focus of
  the game). Shortly thereafter, the tribe laid witness to the deformed birth of
  their prophesied leader, born without a face, and fled Antarctica in fear of
  what the meteorite was capable of. In the present day, the ancient Polynesian
  city has been buried beneath snow and ice and RX Tech are excavating the site,
  investigating the meteorite. Led by Dr. Willard, the crew discovers remnants of
  the Polynesian city, ancient stone statues resembling the Easter Island Moai,
  and finds the grave of a man named Paul Caulfield of the HMS Beagle.
  .
  When the game begins, Lara Croft is in India searching for a legendary stone in
  the ruins of an ancient temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. She
  encounters Tony, an RX Tech employee who seems to be suffering from a severe
  bout of jungle fever. After parting ways, Tony remains one step ahead of Lara in
  their search for the stone, eventually finding it hidden deep within an
  underground cavern. After killing an oddly superhuman Tony, Lara takes the stone
  and exits. On her trek back to the Indian jungle, she is discovered by Dr.
  Willard.

  That pink-haired, pig-thumping jungle boy is at it again. Tomba! 2: The Evil
  Swine Return marks Tomba's second adventure on the PlayStation console. This
  time around Tomba has grown into a young man and is living a peaceful life with
  his friends.
  .
  One day a letter falls from the sky. As Tomba opens it a friendly little bug
  named Zippo pops out and informs him that the evil pigs have returned and are
  invading a neighboring land. Zippo then tells him the worst news of all: The
  evil pigs have kidnapped his childhood friend Tabby. Now Tomba must embark on
  yet another challenging adventure to rescue his friend.
  .
  Tomba! 2 takes place in a brand new 3D world. Using an Adventure Journal to
  record his progress Tomba travels from land to land, talking with townspeople
  and kicking some Swine tail in order to complete numerous mini-quests and rescue
  Tabby. The Adventure Journal keeps track of the items Tomba has acquired, the
  status of events he has discovered, and his current location and condition.
  .
  Throughout his journeys, Tomba finds various weapons and clothing that can alter
  his abilities and aid him in his quests. For example, when Tomba acquires the
  Bird Clothes he is able to glide through the air for a limited time, allowing
  him to overcome obstacles that were previously impassable. Along with weapon
  attacks and special clothes, Tomba still has basic actions allowing him to
  pummel pigs, read signs, climb surfaces, bite and throw enemies, and communicate
  with the townspeople.
  .
  Tomba! 2 features two modes of play. The first is an Action mode where Tomba
  travels along predetermined paths, jumping, fighting and solving action-oriented
  events. The second mode is a Free-Roaming mode where Tomba can move freely in
  360 degrees. While in this mode, Tomba cannot jump or attack with weapons;
  however, no enemies appear and Tomba can focus on completing other events
  without fear of being attacked.
  .
  Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return is a one-player game and uses one memory block
  to save data. Analog control and vibration function is supported. This time the
  Swine have crossed the line. Help Tomba rescue Tabby and defeat the evil pigs
  once and for all.

  the tournament are anything but ordinary: opponents fight each other in armored
  vehicles with mounted weapons. The winner receives an audience with Calypso, and
  is granted a single wish - a wish without limits, be it money, power, or even
  our reality itself. In 2005, the annual tournament is held again in Los Angeles,
  and twelve drivers, each with his own agenda, have come to compete to death.
  .
  Twisted Metal is a vehicular combat game. The player selects one of the twelve
  available drivers and takes part in the competition. In the one-player story
  mode, the player must progress through six combat stages; all the opponents must
  be destroyed in order to win the race. In the two-player co-op mode, players
  choose a battlefield and control two cars in an attempt to get rid of the
  competition.
  .
  All the vehicles are equipped with two mounted machine guns; though relatively
  weak, they have unlimited ammunition. Other weapons can be picked up by driving
  over them during the races. These include fire and homing missiles, land mines,
  tire spikes, and others. Each participant has a life bar, which can be
  replenished by entering a specific area on the stage.

  Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a
  way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main
  difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the
  battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands
  at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new
  strategies and gives the game a unique touch.
  .
  The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that
  was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to
  exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused
  by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant

  Virus - It's Aware is a videogame based in 1999 science fiction-horror film
  directed by visual effects artist John Bruno and starring Jamie Lee Curtis,
  William Baldwin and Donald Sutherland. The film was based on a Dark Horse comic
  book of the same name by Chuck Pfarrer
  .
  When the crew of an American tugboat boards an abandoned Russian research
  vessel, the alien life form aboard regards them as a virus which must be
  destroyed.
  .
  STORY:\n
  When a typhoon cripples their boat, the crew sails into the eye of the storm,
  where they discover a high-tech Russian communications and research vessel
  adrift. Only one Russian crew member is still alive, raving about "intelligent
  lightning." They soon discover that an alien life form has taken over the ship's
  computers and is churning out mechanical warriors. With their own boat
  destroyed, the crew must battle the creature as the ship reenters the storm
  .
  GAMEPLAY:\n
  Virus is an action game for Playstation. You are Joan Averil, brilliant young
  graduate of Criminology. Assistant District Attorney, you end up in charge of an
  odd story: the bodies were found with parts of their body replaced by metal
  parts.
  .
  The character has 9 weapons (9mm, UZI, 38 Special ...) and the game is divided
  into 11 levels. The hardest part of the game is that the game graphics are ugly
  and the gameplay is really poor.

  Wizardry - Llylgamyn Saga is a remake of the first three Wizardry games: Proving
  Grounds of the Mad Overlord, Knight of Diamonds, and Legacy of Llylgamyn. As in
  the original games, the player can create characters choosing from five races
  and eight classes, and level them up by exploring the maze and fighting
  monsters, finding and buying items in process.
  .
  Monster graphics have been updated, and dungeons have been given textures, but
  the player can also opt for original graphics with wireframe dungeons. An
  auto-mapping feature has been added. The player can also transfer characters
  between the three scenarios.
  .
  To put the game in english move options 1 to 4 to the rightest one.
  .
  - Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord:\n
  The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after
  he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him
  by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the
  amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level
  dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the
  dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be
  outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must
  prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally
  retrieve his amulet in the process.
  .
  The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games,
  and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of
  the genre.
  .
  - Knight of Diamonds - The Second Scenario:\n
  The sequel to the original Wizardry follows the defeat of the evil Werdna and
  the return of Mad Overlord Trebor's amulet. The heroes who had accomplished that
  were inducted into Trebor's personal honor guard. Unfortunately this particular
  honor didn't last very long as Trebor's madness and obsession with the amulet
  and preventing Werdna's return drove him to suicide.
  .
  With both Trebor and Werdna dead all seemed well within the kingdom of
  Llylgamyn. Unfortunately, this peace didn't last very long. With Werdna dead and
  out of the limelight, an evil knight named Davalpus felt it was time to make his
  move. He stormed the castle, slaughtered the royal family, and declared himself
  supreme dictator for life. The Prince of the land fought and killed Davalpus
  using the legendary Staff of Gnilda and wearing the armor of the Knight of
  Diamonds. However, the god Gnilda took the staff back and placed it deep within
  his heavily guarded six-level temple. Since the staff's power protects the land
  from invasion by hostile outlanders, someone will need to venture into the
  temple and get it back along with Gnilda's blessing.
  .
  - Legacy of Llylgamyn - The Third Scenario:\n
  A generation has passed since your band of adventurers reclaimed the Staff of
  Gnilda and the armor of the Knight of Diamonds, and the land has been at peace.
  But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as
  earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of
  Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A
  band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb.

description:
  Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life? Is the government
  conspiring to cover up evidence? The truth is out there, but you'll have to go
  looking for it when you take on the role of Craig Willmore, an FBI field agent
  assigned to search for missing agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in Fox
  Interactive's The X-Files.
  .
  Previously a hit PC title, this interactive movie-adventure will take your
  PlayStation console into the realm of the popular X-Files science fiction drama
  series, as you assist the stars in their latest investigation into paranormal
  activity cases.
  .
  Designed from a story written by Chris Carter, The X-Files features many of the
  main cast members from the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner, as
  well as new characters tailored specifically for this game. You'll be
  interviewing witnesses and suspects with the aid of special FBI equipment,
  weapons, and tools. Use them wisely to pick up clues throughout your case and
  follow-up on crime scenes at the crime lab. Discover a plot that thickens as you
  progress.
  .
  The game is viewed from a first-person perspective and features looped video
  footage when you're at a distance from other characters or environments. When
  you move in any direction (by clicking on the pointing hand icons), you'll pass
  through predetermined, fixed frames of digitized scenery. By enabling the
  Navigating Transitions option, you'll experience more realism when turning left
  or right, thanks to a motion-blur effect.
  .
  With the VirtualCinema game engine, the four-disc set breaks new ground
  standards for PlayStation video technology (FPQ 24-bit), enabling greater
  compression at the highest quality for video playback. The original footage was
  shot live, entirely on location in the Pacific Northwest. As you come upon
  something of importance, such as an FBI agent, a witness or even new items, a
  video clip starts to play.
  .
  You'll be making some critical, multiple-choice decisions. The game consists of
  multiple plot lines and at times, three icons will appear at the bottom of the
  screen indicating which attitude you want to take towards a certain person. This
  will affect the next outcome of game flow - be careful what you wish for!
  .
  Some of the tools you'll be using are a PDA (or Personal Digital Assistant), a
  cellular phone, your badge, a gun and handcuffs, an evidence kit and lock pick,
  a digital camera, a flashlight, a pair of binoculars, and night vision goggles.
  Your PDA is one of your best friends because it allows you to take notes, e-mail
  reports to your superiors, and utilize the internal map to locate specific
  areas.
  .
  Another mission-critical item you'll be using is your very own desktop
  workstation, which features the ING (Intelligence Network Gateway). With this
  tool you'll have access to background checks, vehicle license plate numbers,
  phone number tracing, a database with a full search engine, a Photo Viewer for
  your camera, e-mail, and important messages and All Points Bulletins.
