  .
  The gameplay is a cross between Overlord and Pikmin, giving you command of a
  group of Goblins who fight for you. They are divided into three different types
  – Soldiers, Spearmen, and Magi. Soldiers are your basic workhorse fighters,
  you'll chuck them at your enemies and stack them up in order to pull off
  high-damage yielding Salvo attacks, while Spearmen are long-range, narrow
  attackers. The final class, Magi, require you to charge up their attacks, but
  are capable of hitting protected targets, like enemies that are covered in fire
  for example. You can also set your different unit types into formations,
  resulting in improved attack power, defense, and mobility depending in which
  unit type you're using.

  Bard's Gold is a challenging platformer that let's you explore eerie worlds in a
  quest for a Goblin that stole your gold. Help the Bard to overcome the dungeon’s
  many dangerous perils and use your new-found treasures to improve your character
  and to buy new weapons and gear!
  .
  .
  This game takes inspiration from early 90's platforming classics such as Rainbow
  Island, Rick Dangerous, Alex Kidd and Erik, which at the time were popular on
  the Amiga and consoles. Bard's Gold is slower paced than most current day
  platformers, but is extemely challenging. Players need to avoid enemies, traps
  and projectiles in order to progress. Being hit by any of them means instant
  death. Difficult puzzles and towering bosses will have to be overcome to reach
  the filthy goblin that stole the family treasure.

game: Bastion (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation Vita/Bastion (USA)/Bastion (USA).json
developer: Supergiant Games
publisher: Limited Run Games
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Bastion is an isometric action/role playing game. It's the story of a city known
  as Caelondia after it has been destroyed by a disaster called "Calamity". The
  game follows a silent protagonist known as "The Kid" who tries to create a safe
  haven (Bastion) with the help of Rucks, who is also the narrator of the game.
  The kid has to defeat the game's many foes with a variety of melee and ranged
  weapons and also special skills. The Bastion, which acts as some sort of
  headquarters in the game, can be upgraded with useful buildings as the player
  progresses.
  .
  As the Kid travels through the world, he will discover new weapons, upgrade
  materials, mementos and fragments. Mementos can be discussed with other
  characters residing in the Bastion and may reveal more about the world. The Kid
  can only hold two weapons and one special skill at a time, which may require
  switching them with others, considering the player's preferences and the
  enemies' weaknesses. The fragments are the game's main currency and they can be
  collected after destroying objects, defeating enemies and, sometimes, by simply
  finding them. The player can later use them in the Bastion in order to purchase
  upgrades and useful trinkets.
  .
  The Bastion encloses a total of six buildings which the Kid can restore and
  utilize. In the Distillery, the player can assign spirits (drinks) to a maximum
  of ten slots, providing various passive bonuses during the gameplay. At the
  beginning, only one slot is available for use, the rest being unlocked one by
  one every time the Kid levels up. The Arsenal stores all the weapons that the
  protagonist gathers during his adventures; the player can switch weapons and
  special skills here. The weapons are enhanced and upgraded in the Forge, and
  this is possible only after collecting the required upgrade materials in the
  world. The Memorial offers various challenges, which if completed reward the
  player with additional fragments. In Lost-and-Found, the player can spend
  fragments in order to restore upgrade materials and unlock idols and spirits.
  Finally, the game difficulty can be increased by invoking the gods in the
  Shrine.
  .
  One of the notable features in the game is dynamic narration. Narrating in the
  game is based on the player's actions. For example, when the kid has fallen from
  a height the narrator gives a comment about the incident.

developer: Gaijin Games
publisher: Gaijin Games
genre: Action
description:
  Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is the sequel to Bit.Trip Runner. The
  game's look and feel is very different from the original. Runner 2 forgoes the
  original's retro look in favor of a cartoon art style. The game's story takes on
  a more humorous tone, and is narrated by Charles Martinet.
  .
  The game expands on the original in several ways. There are several new actions,
  such as rotating the analog stick to trace Commander Video's path around a loop.
  In addition, level selection takes place on a map screen laid out similar to
  other classic platform games. Levels offer alternate paths which can be either
  easier or harder to complete depending on the path. There are also mid-level
  checkpoints, though these are optional, and the player earns more points if
  he/she chooses to skip them. Collecting all gold in each stage allows the player
  to shoot Commander Video out of a cannon into a target to score extra points.
  .
  There are several characters that can be unlocked, as well as several costumes
  for each one.
  .
  The game offers 120 levels, online leaderboards for each individual stage, and
  multiple difficulties for replay value.

  This tough-as-nails collection of retro-inspired music/rhythm games will make

  to keep an eye on their blood pressure, we’ve also added in the ability to
  toggle the difficulty in each game. Because we care.    Not for the faint of
  heart, THE BIT.TRIP is deceptively hardcore. It will take you through the origin

  Deadbolt is a side-scrolling stealth-action which puts the player in the role of
  the Grim Reaper, taking out supernatural entities such as zombies, vampires and
  skeletons. The game is divided into levels in which the player is usually
  required to take out all the enemies, and can do so with a selection of melee
  and ranged weapons, picked up in the level or bought from a guns salesman.
  .
  Similar to Hotline Miami, enemies have quick response times and the player can
  die with a single shot. That requires the player to either respond quickly to
  threats, or use the level's environment to his advantage: The player can turn
  off or shoot lights to avoid being seen, and use vents to move around the level.
  .
  Each level introduces a new gameplay element, enemy, or offers a unique twist.
  For example, one level is rigged with traps, which the player must watch out
  for, but the traps can also be used against enemies. Another level has a sniper
  trying to get the player, so he must remain in the dark or watch out for the
  sniper's laser sight.

  ou awaken in a decrepit old mansion.
  .
  A woman with eyes of jade stands before You, informing You that You are the
  Master of the house, and she Your Maid. However, You have no memories, no
  concept of self—or, indeed, any certainty that You are even alive.
  .
  The Maid invites You to join her on a journey through the mansion's lifeless
  halls, to behold the numerous tragedies that have befallen its residents. She
  suggests that among them, perhaps You will find some trace of Yourself.
  .
  Beyond the first door lies the year 1603.\n
  It is an era of unparalleled beauty, where art and theatre flourish. Roses bloom
  abundantly in the garden where the inseparable Rhodes siblings play, and though
  they appear to be free of worry and strife... not everyone is content to see
  them happy.
  .
  Beyond the second door lies the year 1707.\n
  In this era, the mansion lies in ruins, and a beast dwells within. He claims to
  yearn for a life of serenity, but it is not long before he yields to his innate
  savagery and a massacre ensues.
  .
  Beyond the third door lies the year 1869.\n
  In this technologically advanced era, people are always on the move. The
  mansion's master is an ambitious businessman who has invested in the rail
  industry. However, his obsession with wealth and power leads him to neglect and
  mistreat his wife.
  .
  Beyond the fourth door lies the year 1099.\n
  The Maid tells You that this is the final tale. In this era, You see a young man
  who claims to be cursed and a girl with white hair, called Giselle, who has been
  branded a witch and marked for death.
  .
  Having borne witness to these four tragedies, each set in a different time and
  place, You are now free to choose whether You wish to end Your story here... or
  press on.

  But there are those who would say,
  .
  "You were able to bear them because they weren't your tragedies."

developer: Fiddlesticks
publisher: Curve Digital
genre: Action;Puzzle
description:
  Hue is a puzzle game played as a side-scrolling platformer. The player controls
  the male character Hue who needs to find back his missing mother. She developed
  a ring called Annular Spectrum which allows perception and alteration of
  impossible colours, beyond the human spectrum. She was deceived by the
  traitorous professor Dr. Grey she fell in love with and has now become
  invisible, as a shade of such as impossible colour. It is up to Hue to restore
  the ring and bring her back by collecting the many scattered coloured shards.
  .
  The game consists of a large, 2D side-scrolling world where different
  environments are linked together through doors. The game uses a silhouetted art
  style which is initially monochromatic. Soon Hue discovers his first colour,
  which is added to a ring-like circle that can be summoned at any moment, as one
  of many bright colours. Eventually eight colours can be collected: aqua, blue,
  lime, orange, pink, purple, red and yellow. These are used for the main gameplay
  mechanic as the player can switch between them on the fly, even in the middle of
  actions as time is slowed down extensively during the selection. Changing a
  colour brings it into the environment, colouring almost anything. This mechanic
  is for instance used to discover hidden doors. Obstacles, barriers and other
  elements often have a specific colour and when Hue switches colours to match it,
  it disappears into the environment as if it was never there. The simple mechanic
  quickly becomes more complex due to moving elements, the ability to push and
  pull objects, platform-based puzzles, fast sequences and so on. While Hue can
  jump and there are some general elements such as ladders or deadly spikes,
  almost every area needs to be approached as a puzzle that can be solved without
  time pressure.

  La-Mulana is a remake of the original La-Mulana released in 2005. It is an
  explorable platformer / metroidvania, or, as described by the authors
  "Archaeological Ruin Exploration Action Game" with hardcore difficulty of
  platforming action and puzzles. The vast world of the original game was rebuilt
  from the ground up with various tweaks made to the gameplay and presentation:\n
  Visually the game now resembles 32-bit 2D games of PlayStation and Sega Saturn
  era;\n
  The soundtrack was rearranged with different instruments in tone with the new
  presentation;\n
  Many puzzles were altered to be more accessible and some were removed all
  together, while the difficulty of the actual gameplay was generally increased;\n
  The location of many items was modified; new rooms, enemies and items were
  added;\n
  New sub-bosses were added; many of earlier sub-bosses and all the Guardian
  bosses were significantly modified (both in terms of presentation and behaviour
  patterns);\n
  In-game software system was tweaked, all references to classic MSX games were
  removed);\n
  Many control issues and minor gameplay elements were corrected based on players'
  feedback.\n
  This remake was first released on Nintendo's WiiWare service. Due to the
  file-size limitations it didn't include the optional content - Hell Temple area
  and Time Attack mode, which were later available as additional download in
  Japan. The later PC port includes this content within the base game. The PS Vita
  version, called La-Mulana EX, features further improvements to the gameplay as
  well as new bestiary and rearrangement of several item placements.

developer: Double Eleven
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
genre: Platform
description:
  The core mechanics of the series revolve around its tagline "Play, Create,
  Share".\n
  The Play component involves players taking control of Sackboy and navigating him
  through various levels. In the first two instalments of the series, gameplay
  consisted primarily of traditional platforming like jumping and avoiding
  obstacles to successfully navigate to the end of a level to win. Since
  LittleBigPlanet 2, gameplay has expanded to being a "platform for games" with
  the introduction of numerous mini-games and other genres into the game
  diversifying the game from being strictly a traditional platforming game. Most
  LittleBigPlanet games involve a player playing solo or co-operatively with
  friends to navigate through a level whilst collecting various "prize bubbles"
  along the way. These prize bubbles come in two types, small ones which
  constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other
  type of collectibles that can be used to customise Sackboy or in level creation.
  There are also numerous co-operative parts of levels whereby certain prize
  bubbles can only be collected with the help of at least one player or more
  depending on the number of players stated in the level.

developer: Young Horses
publisher: Young Horses
genre: Action
description:
  In Octodad: Dadliest Catch, the player takes the role of a loving fiancé and
  father of two kids. He is also a octopus in a suit who lives unrecognized in the
  human world. The majority of the time is spent with mundane tasks, e.g.
  preparing the protagonist's wedding ceremony, but unfortunately one person knows
  the secret: a crazy chef who is in the mood for sushi...
  .
  This is commercial and further developed successor to the freeware game Octodad.
  While the objectives themselves are not too complicated, e.g. doing the dishes,
  the challenge comes from the fact that each limb is controlled separately. Of
  course this makes coordinated movement hard and, along with the deliberately
  oversensitive physics simulation, results in chaos and slapstick moments.
  However, making chaos when other people are watching fills up a suspicion meter
  which eventually causes Octodad to be recognized and leads to a game over.
  Sometimes there are small stealth sequences in which the protagonist can't be
  seen at all.
  .
  After finishing the campaign, the six levels can be replayed in order to find
  hidden ties or beating the developers' best time. In co-op mode, each player
  controls one limb (or two with less than four participants). The level editor is
  exclusive to the Windows version, but the user levels can also be played on
  Macintosh and Linux.

  subordinate colleagues. After all, Enforcers possess high Crime Coefficients.
  However, because of their criminal nature, they can better understand what makes
  other criminals tick, allowing them to sniff out suspects and arrest the true
  perpetrators. But because of their criminal background, Inspectors are needed to
  provide a calm and sound judgement to each case. Ultimately, all members of the
  MWPSB have to walk a fine line, maintaining their own mental health while facing
  the worst that society has to offer.

genre: Puzzle
description:
  Papers Please is a simulation game based on the life of a immigration inspector
  charged with checking passports at the border of a fictional communist state,
  Arztoska. The game is set after the conclusion of a six year war with
  neighboring Kolechia, the war has moved the combatants boarded and left the city
  of Greznin split. Kolechia controls the west and Arztoska the east. The game
  begins with the player being selected for border duty in Arztoska's monthly
  labor lottery. He (the player character is unnamed) and his family are relocated
  to the city of Greznin.
  .
  Gameplay takes the form of checking the documents of people wishing to cross the
  border. Initially this is a task of making sure that no documents are expired or
  that cities and countries where the documents come from are real. However, as
  events such as the deterioration of relations with neighboring powers and
  terrorist attacks on the border, take place the D.O.I. (Department of
  Immigration) require documents to become more complicated. The player will have
  to juggle checking, crosschecking and rechecking supplemental IDs, work permits,
  vaccination records, and more. Complications can include anything from simple
  misspellings to changing heights, or circumstances that require strip searches.
  .
  In addition to simply deciding based on the information in the documents the
  player will be offered bribes, be pleaded with, and be threatened. Moral choice
  may come to play a role in who the player allows of denies. The player is
  rewarded for each applicant processed with a bonus on his paycheck at the end of
  the day. Applicants who are allowed to enter while their documents were not in
  order, or one sent away when they were clear for entry will result in a warning.
  The paycheck of the immigration inspector is penalized for every mistake past
  two in a day.
  .
  At the end of the day the immigration inspector returns home and must use his
  meager salary to cover the expenses, of heat, food, and medicine for his family.
  Keeping the family alive becomes an important aspect of the game as it will end
  should all members die. Arztoska requires public servants to have large
  families, a sign of patriotism.
  .
  Many of the characters that the player interacts with are randomly generated,
  but a number of characters will have specific story arcs. One such arc is that
  of The Order of the EZIC Star, a group bent on regime change. The Order will
  send a hooded messenger to give the immigration inspector commands about how to
  admit their agents into Arztoska or may even ask him to kill.
  .
  There are a little over thirty ingame days and twenty endings. The immigration
  inspector may end up imprisoned, a loyal member of the bureaucracy, murdered,
  executed and more.

developer: Arcade Distillery
publisher: Arcade Distillery
genre: Strategy
description:
  Set around a city being consumed from within by a disease, Plague Road tells a
  story of a lone doctor who once abandoned their home and now returns to learn
  the fate of those they left behind. Travel from the safe refuge of your farm
  through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague.
  .
  On the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling
  companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How
  your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work.
  .
  Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful
  still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your
  ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring
  grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.
  .
  Traverse four regions with procedurally generated stages, featuring richly
  illustrated 2D art, music from award-winning composer Sean Beeson and narration
  performed by Jim Sterling.

developer: Flippfly LLC
publisher: Flippfly LLC
genre: Racing
description:
  Race the Sun is an endless racer set in an abstract environment. The player
  controls a solar craft hovering above the surface and it needs to survive as
  long as possible, racing after the sun that provides the power to move on. The
  game world is procedurally generated and changes each day. It is divided into
  regions with a completely different lay-out each day, but with fixed mutators
  for each region to build a similar difficulty curve for every session.
  .
  To survive the craft needs to dodge moving and falling blocks, pillars, shapes
  and projectiles that appear in quick succession. Acceleration is done
  automatically and it cannot be slowed down. The craft can be steered left and
  right endlessly, as there is no border to the game world. The quickest way to
  gain speed is by picking up yellow boost items, slightly reversing the sun path
  for a while. Green items provide a jump that can be triggered at any moment,
  allowing the craft to fly. Purple ones provide a second chance after a crash.
  Obstacles are not the only concern, as tunnels, clouds or objects blacking out
  the sun also need to be avoided as they deplete the available energy. The game
  is over when there is no more sunlight or after a crash. Along the way blue tris
  can be collected, triangles that add up to a score multiplier. When bumping into
  an obstacle, not causing a complete collision, some speed is lost and the
  multiplier is reset. The gameplay is fast-paced and requires good reflexes in
  the later regions. By steering in a certain direction and quickly switching, a
  barrel roll can be performed.
  .
  The game offers different objectives that can be completed over multiple
  sessions, such as achieving a certain amount of air time, clearing a region
  without a single collision, collecting a number of tris, achieving a certain
  score etc. This allows the craft to level up with a cap at 25. With almost every
  level some new options become available, such as decals for the ship or
  attachments. The latter include a magnet that collects nearby pick-ups
  automatically, a battery to survive longer without energy, storage for multiple
  jump pick-ups or shields etc. These have an upgraded version as well. It is
  possible to fit multiple attachments at a certain level and another type of
  bonus provides a higher multiplier level at the start.
  .
  After a while a secondary Apocalypse mode is unlocked, set in a different world
  with a higher difficulty level and meteorites that cause temporary blindness.
  The game's editor support the creation and sharing of user made levels through
  the Steam workshop. These can be downloaded and played separately and some are
  also accessed in the game's main mode through world portals in the game world,
  temporarily moving the game into a very different environment before continuing.
  There are global leaderboards to compare scores.
  .
  In February 2015 the unlockable Labyrinthia mode was added. It is an advanced,
  randomized maze filled with obstacles, switches and moving parts. It largely
  takes the sun and reflex based movement out of the equation in favour of
  planning ahead. It uses a more zoomed out view.

  Rainbow Moon is a Strategy-RPG from the makers of the hit Soldner-X franchise.
  Cursed by his long-time enemy, Baldren founds himself warped to Rainbow Moon.
  And to make things worse, Baldren isn't only stranded in an unknown place – he
  has also opened a dimensional gate, out of which troops of monsters are
  crawling, turning this once peaceful planet into a real hell.
  .
  The residents of Rainbow Moon who have found themselves in this sudden and
  unpleasant situation react suspiciously and even nastily, which certainly
  doesn't make things any easier for our brave hero. There's only one thing for
  Baldren to do: he has to seal the gate and warp himself back to his home planet.
  This is easier said than done, since the gate can only be sealed by a
  dimensional gate staff and no such object is available anywhere on Rainbow Moon.
  However Baldren knows that he can create one if he finds the right materials. He
  needs seven magical artifacts, said to be hidden deep inside Rainbow Moon's
  dungeons.
  .
  And this is where our quest begins ...

developer: Hopoo Games
publisher: Hopoo Games
genre: Action;Platform
description:
  Risk of Rain is a roguelike platformer with a sci-fi setting. The player is the
  lone survivor of a space train that got shot out of orbit and crash landed on a
  mysterious planet.
  .
  Each stage starts with the player spawning in a random spot. The first aim is to
  find a teleporter, also randomly spawned somewhere in that stage. When the
  teleporter is found and activated, it will take 90 seconds to be fully active.
  During this time, several enemies will spawn, including a boss. After the
  teleporter loading time is complete, the player must then kill all enemies that
  are left in order to be teleported to the next stage.
  .
  One distinctive feature of the game is that difficulty increases over time: a
  difficulty bar is shown in the top right corner of the screen. Every five
  minutes the difficulty increases one level, so the quicker the player finds his
  way out of stages, the easier the later stages are. In order to keep up with the
  challenge, the players must equip their characters with items that were being
  carried by the space train. There are more than 100 different items (most of
  which must be unlocked), each with a different effect, such as inflicting damage
  to enemies as they approach the player, increasing healing rate, slowing down
  hit enemies, double jump, etc. The effects are stackable, so if two or more
  items of the same kind are collected a multiplier will be added to it. Items are
  dropped by boss enemies, but are more commonly found in locked chests. To unlock
  chests, players must collect money dropped by enemies when killed. Money is also
  used to activate drones that will help the player.
  .
  Players can choose different characters, each one with different skills. Every
  character has 4 different actions, like different weapons or defensive
  maneuvers, plus one usable item slot. There are 12 different characters
  available, but they must be unlocked by finding items or performing some
  achievements.

developer: Size Five Games
publisher: Curve Digital
genre: Action;Platform;Stealth
description:
  The Swindle is a steampunk, 2D side-scrolling game about heists. It is set in
  London in 1849 and the player takes control of a master burglar. In 100 days
  Scotland Yard will activate The Devil's Basilisk, advanced artificial
  intelligence technology that will massively improve surveillance and make theft
  almost impossible. Therefore the thief has 100 days to steal the Basilisk and
  prevent it from being activated.
  .
  The master burglar is never seen in the game and does not take part in the
  action. Instead he sends out lower thieves to perform heists. A thief is sent
  down from an airship, the main hub, using a pod. When the heist is successful
  the thief can return to the airship with the haul where the money can be spent
  in five skill trees: agility, abilities, tools, goggles and miscellaneous. The
  game consists of six main locations that are randomly generated for level
  design, enemies and items with each new heist. By earning money the main goal is
  to buy additional security clearance, opening up new locations, until the
  Basilisk can be stolen in the final location to win the game. The six main
  locations are The Slums, Warehouse District, New Belgravia, Casino Town, The
  Banks, and The Swindle. Each started heist, whether successful or not, takes up
  a single day. The game is lost if the Basilisk is not stolen in 100 days because
  the game ends after that limit. Each new location provides opportunities to
  steal a lot more money, but also introduces more difficulty security and more
  dangerous guards. That way the game challenges the player to take calculated
  risks. By saving up it is possible to move on to harder locations quickly, but
  the money can also be spent on various perks that make the heists easier
  instead. The thief characters can die or be terminated and a random one is then
  generated for each new heist after an unsuccessful one. The player is however
  encouraged to carry on with a single character as an experience bonus is
  provided for completing consecutive heists with the same thief. Bonus are also
  provided for completing levels without being spotted (ghost) and rewarding
  aptitude.
  .
  Each heist takes place in a side-scrolling, fairly small area with connected
  rooms. There are various approaches through doors, climbing pipes, creating
  entrances with bombs or smashing windows. The character can move around and
  jump. By upgrading elements in the agility skill tree additional options can be
  unlocked and often be upgraded multiple times, such as wall jumping and clinging
  to walls, double jumping and stealth. Most early enemies have a line of sight
  that is visible to the player, but from New Belgravia onwards enemies with a
  microphone icon are sensitive to sound and then the slower sneaking method has
  to be used for movement. Enemies can be taken out by whacking them. Some enemies
  require multiple hits and others cannot be destroyed permanently with the
  regular weapon. Unlockable abilities include a hacking skill to disarm bombs,
  open doors and open cash machines. This is done through a short mini-game where
  the player has to follow the directions on the screen to press one of four
  directions, sometimes multiple times. When a mistake is made while disarming a
  bomb, it explodes right away, killing the thief. Other abilities are bionic
  eyes, improved hacking, barging through doors and so on. Many different tools
  can also be unlocked that can be selected during heists. They are bombs to blow
  through walls, steam purge to use a cloud that obscures vision, bugs that syphon
  funds, EMPs and so on. Many of these have a limit or use a separate meter that
  takes some time to recharge. It is possible to switch between tools at any time
  during a level and they are all available when unlocked. There are also four
  types of goggles to unlock and other technology such as jamming radio
  transmissions or improvements for tools and abilities.
  .
  When a thief is killed, no money is gathered from that heist and a new one needs
  to be sent out. All levels offer multiple approaches through the tools and
  abilities. Doors can be opened or closed, many elements can be hacked and custom
  passages can be created with bombs. Each location introduces new elements to
  levels and new types of enemies that need to be analyzed. When the thief is
  spotted, the alarms are sounded right away. All enemies then become much faster
  and more aggressive. The funds in the levels are then also drained gradually to
  move them elsewhere. The thief can however still finish the level by returning
  to the pod, but has to watch out for a powerful police character that soon
  arrives. It has some roguelike elements (character permadeath, random levels),
  but perks are permanent and carried over to a new thief as long as there are
  days left. Perks are also bought specifically and are not offered from a random
  selection.

publisher: Drinkbox Studios
genre: Platform;Puzzle
description:
  Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack is a 2D puzzle platformer about an alien,
  mutant blob who manages to escape from a store where they are sold to humans.
  Through six large worlds (College, Town, Moon, Badlands, Army Base and
  Metropolis), with multiple levels each, the blob needs to complete levels and
  optionally free captured blobs along the way. The game has a bright visual style
  inspired by 50's art and corresponding music, and uses a lot of B-movie-inspired
  humor with many references to other indie games in the background environment.
  .
  The blob can move left and right and jump. While in the air a dash can be
  performed to quickly move down, also to destroy objects below. Levels are
  usually split up in smaller sections with multiple checkpoints, locked through a
  cork. In order to pass, the blob needs to absorbs various objects along the way
  to grow to the required size. Similar to the Katamari games certain items can
  only be absorbed when a certain size has been reached. As a blob it is also able
  to squeeze through narrow passages.
  .
  Various gameplay elements are introduced gradually. Through telekinesis certain
  objects such as platforms can be moved. In sections with magnetism it is
  possible to stick to magnetic surfaces or repel from them by changing polarity,
  gaining boost. There are also sections where the blob can be moved freely around
  the environment, boosting around in any direction with a more powerful boost to
  gain speed. Next to the main levels various mini-game levels can be unlocked
  where courses need to be completed. Depending on the objects sometimes multiple
  hits can be taken and health is recharged at the next checkpoint. Various small
  blue orbs can be eaten to reach a high score, tracked on global leaderboards.
  Blob friends are hidden in each level where they can be freed.

  Teslagrad is a side-scrolling platformer with strong puzzle elements. The

  game communicates without words.
  .
  The player moves inside the tower which can be freely explored (but, as it is a
  tower, the general direction is up and there are not many branches in width). To
  progress, the player needs to use special abilities to solve puzzles which are
  all based on magnetic fields: many objects have a magnetic field (red or blue);
  objects with different colours are attracted to each other while objects of the
  same colour are repelled. The player has gloves which allow him to change the
  polarity of objects. During the course of the games, more abilities and gadgets
  are earned, e.g. a cannon to change polarity over distances or a short-distance
  teleport to pass deadly currency unharmed. Those are used to reach new parts of
  the tower. The puzzles are mostly embedded in platforming challenges which
  require pixel-perfect jumping and fast reactions. There are also a few boss
  battles.

developer: Mike Bithell
publisher: Mike Bithell
genre: Action
description:
  Volume is a stealth game presented as a modern take on the legend of Robin Hood
  as the protagonist is also called Robert Locksley and it is also about someone
  who steals from the rich, but in a digital age. He is a thief who finds a device
  called Volume that is a military training simulator, but allows users to
  simulate heists in virtual worlds as well. The game opens showing how Locksley
  is discovered and captured. It then rewinds three hours and 100 missions explain
  what happened before. Locksley broadcasts his simulated heists over the internet
  for anyone to match and finds an antagonist in Guy Gisborne, CEO of Gisborne
  Industries, who has also taken over the country of England. More of the story
  and the background is revealed through notes found during missions. Volume also
  has artificial intelligence called Alan who guides Locksley through the
  mechanics and has conversations about events while the missions are in progress.
  .
  The game is played from an elevated, almost top-down perspective and consists of
  short, maze-like levels. To complete a level Locksley needs to collect all gems
  and then the exit opens up. Levels are guarded by characters called Pawns. They
  are stationary or patrol and it is possible to see their line of sight through a
  cone. When they discover Locksley they go after him and shoot. The level then
  has to be restarted unless a checkpoint has been activated first. There are no
  means to kill opponents, so strategy is always about distractions and staying
  unnoticed. Locksley can cling to walls, with slower movement, but at the same
  time ducking slightly to stay out of sight when near lower objects. The game
  moves to a completely top-down perspective at that time and it is possible to
  hop between walls around corners. He can also move in any direction while
  walking regularly.
  .
  The initial approach to distract guards is by whistling, but eventually many
  types of gadgets are introduced. Gadgets can only be used when they are present
  in levels. The first one introduced is the Bugle that can be fired in any
  direction. When it is set off, also in flight, it makes a sound that draws
  attention. The Oddity has similar mechanics, but can only be shot at a high
  wall, where it will attract the attention of a guard for some time when it is
  spotted. Mute gives a temporary speed boost and mutes the sound of pressure
  plates. Gadgets generally take some time to recharge, but can be used without
  limits. During levels only one gadget can be carried at a time. Locksley can
  also flush toilets or run water taps to create sounds, and he can hide in
  closets behind doors.
  .
  Advanced levels include new types of opponents such as turrets, and hounds with
  a 180 degrees line of sight. Guards will often activate alarms alerting the
  others when Locksley is spotted. They will then run much faster and it can only
  be averted by hiding for a while or hacking the security system to disable the
  alarm. Some levels have pressure plates that make a sound and sometimes there
  are forcefields blocking the path that require some time to deactivate. Levels
  do not always have a single solution and can often be solved in different ways.
  .
  The game includes an editor that allows users to create and share custom levels
  online. It is also possible to edit and remix the existing levels.

  A bustling town deep in the frontier at the foot of an endless sea of trees...
  It is into this wild and untamed setting that a young man collapses, memories
  gone and only his name to guide him.
  .
  Bereft of his past, Adol Cristin wanders the town of Casnan searching for clues
  to his identity. Joined by an information dealer who claims to have known him,
  the young adventurer helps rescue doomed miners from a collapse; an act which
  attracts the attention of the Romun Army general in town. Impressed with their
  skills, the pair is enlisted to explore the Great Forest and map the vast
  expanses of Celceta – a task which many have attempted in the past, but from
  which none have ever returned alive.
  .
  Alone in this strange and uncharted frontier, Adol must brave the perilous sea
  of trees as he struggles to regain his memories and decide whom he can trust,
  and who is simply attempting to take advantage of his memory loss in order to
  deceive him...

  The events of Ys Origin take place 700 years before those depicted in Ys: The
  Vanished Omens; it is the first game in the timeline of Ys, and a prequel to the
  entire series. It is also the first Ys game in which the main protagonist is not
  Adol Christin, the red-haired swordsman and recurrent hero of the series.
  .
  There are three main playable characters in the game: Yunica Tovah, a young
  apprentice knight; Hugo Fact, a skillful magician; and a mysterious person known
  as The Claw, who can be unlocked only after having completed the game with the
  other two. These characters venture to the sinister Darm Tower, each having her
  or his own motives. The three also vary in gameplay style: Yunica plays
  similarly to Adol from the previous games, specializing in melee combat with
  swords and axes; Hugo fires magical bullets with his staff and has access to
  other types of magic; The Claw is distinguished by his speed in close combat.
  .
  The game is set entirely in the Darm Tower, discarding the overworld and
  populated areas of the previous games. The fast-paced action RPG gameplay is
  similar to the one adopted in Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim and Ys: The Oath in
  Felghana. As the story progresses, characters acquire skills that can be
  combined in order to extend battle strategy. Some of the bosses from the first
  and the second Ys re-appear in this game.
