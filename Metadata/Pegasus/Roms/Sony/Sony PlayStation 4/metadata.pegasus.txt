game: Hidden Agenda (USA)
file: $ROM_JSON_ROOT/Sony/Sony PlayStation 4/Hidden Agenda (USA)/Hidden Agenda (USA).json
developer: Supermassive Games
publisher: Sony Computer Entertainment
genre: Action;Adventure
description:
  Hidden Agenda is a detective mystery thriller following two protagonists; Becky
  Marney, a police officer who after capturing the infamous Trapper serial killer
  gets promoted to a homicide detective, and Felicity Graves, district attorney
  who convicted the Trapper. Five years have passed since Finn was caught and
  accused of the series murders, and his admitting to crimes didn't play in his
  favor. Finn is about to be executed in a couple of days and Felicity goes in for
  a talk with him only to find herself questioning if he is the real killer.
  .
  The story now takes turn based entirely on player's choices, it may lead you to
  believe that Finn really is the killer, or that he was protecting the real
  killer, or even the player may end up being a primary suspect in the killings.
  The game is played entirely via smartphone app and requires both PS4 device and
  your smartphone to be on the same wi-fi network. Upon starting the PS4 game, the
  smartphone app will be able to join and the player gets to select his name and
  color which is mostly used to distinguish multiple players when playing
  competitive mode where each of the players have his/her own hidden agenda to
  achieve or prevent other players from achieving.
  .
  The story mode is most suitable for single player who can determine the
  narration of the entire game by making choices for the two protagonists. Game is
  paused and resumed via smartphone app only, and as the story progresses new
  characters, ripple effects, and plot progress get marked which can be checked on
  the smartphone app. Interaction with the game story is done in several different
  ways, depending on the scene in question. Most common is the choice you
  determine for your character, whether it is an action to perform or the way you
  wish Becky or Felicity to answer to a question being asked. Clue searching
  scenes prompt you to find 3 on-screen clues within the allotted time which
  affects story that follows, and quick-time events which are seldom, prompt the
  player to quickly drag the cursor to a point of interest to make the character
  pass unobstructed (i.e. not to stumble on a crate while chasing a suspect). And
  last, the player is sometimes able to shoot at the character on the screen.
  Doing nothing in either of the interactions or prompted choices is also an
  option and depending on the situation may even be a good choice.
  .
  Key choices in the game that affect the story in big way are called ripple
  effects and are marked on the smartphone app. In general, whenever the plot
  changes, new character info is uncovered, or ripple effect activated, the
  smartphone app will add it to the logbook for the players to check at any point
  during gameplay, whether the game is paused or not. The story is split into 3
  chapters overall and between each of the chapters all the ripple effects that
  will affect further story are displayed.
