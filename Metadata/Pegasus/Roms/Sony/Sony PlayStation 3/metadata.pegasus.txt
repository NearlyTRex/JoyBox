  Deadly Premonition is an open world, survival horror video game developed by
  Access Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In 2010, the Xbox 360 version was
  published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in
  Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe, while the PlayStation 3 version was
  simultaneously released only in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment. A director's
  cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by
  Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of
  Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York
  Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is
  similar to a series of murders across the United States.
  .
  Deadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video
  game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after
  its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues.
  .
  The game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy
  horror theme to the survival horror genre. It is also notable for implementing a
  free-roaming storyline within an open game world where all the characters have
  their own schedules.
  .
  It has become known for its "headline making strangeness" and is considered one
  of the most critically polarising games of all-time (holding the Guinness World
  Record for most critically polarizing survival horror game), receiving both
  extremely negative and extremely positive reviews and is seen by some as an
  example of games as art.

  Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and the Take-Two
  Interactive subsidiary, 2K Games. It is the fourth installment in The Elder
  Scrolls action fantasy video game series, following The Elder Scrolls III:
  Morrowind and preceding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Oblivion was first released
  in March 2006 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. A mobile phone version of the
  game was released in May 2006, and a PlayStation 3 version was shipped in March
  2007. After a number of smaller content releases, a major expansion pack,
  Shivering Isles, was distributed. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the
  Year Edition (a package including both Shivering Isles and the official
  expansion pack Knights of the Nine) was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows,
  Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. A fifth-anniversary edition was shipped in 2011.
  .
  Oblivion '​s main story revolves around the player character's efforts to thwart
  a fanatical cult known as the "Mythic Dawn" that plans to open the gates to a
  realm called "Oblivion". The game continues the open world tradition of its
  predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any
  time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual
  objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are
  numerical representations of certain abilities. Seven skills are selected early
  in the game as major skills, with the remainder termed minor. Developers opted
  for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles.
  .
  Development for Oblivion began in 2002, directly after the release of Morrowind.
  To design the graphics, Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine, high
  dynamic range lighting, procedural content generation tools that allowed
  developers to quickly create detailed terrains, and the Radiant A.I. system,
  which enabled non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in
  behaviors more complex than in past titles. The game features fully voiced
  NPCs—a first for the series—and the music of award-winning composer Jeremy
  Soule. Overall, Oblivion was well received by critics, and has won a number of
  industry and publication awards. It was praised for its impressive graphics,
  expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Within a month, the game had
  shipped over 1.7 million copies, and by November 2011, sold over 3.5 million.
  Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates
  that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide.

  Playstation 3 and was later released on October 25, 2013.
  .
  The story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu
  Cheng'en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of
  ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world
  following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the
  still active war machines left over from the conflict. Like the original story
  however, the plot revolves around someone who forces the help and protection of
  a warrior, with many characters sharing the same names and roles. The game's
  story was written by Alex Garland, with voice talent and motion capture from
  Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.

  controls is often referred to as one of the best, and/or most popular single
  player action games series ever made for PlayStation 2. The truth in this can be
  seen in the fact that in an era dominated by more advanced game consoles, fans
  of the franchise who have held on to their PS2's still revisit these two games
  from time to time, while gamers who missed their initial releases are tempted to
  give them a try, even though they have moved on to a PS3. Regardless which side
  of this you find yourself on the God of War Collection holds something for you.

  .
  KINGDOM HEARTS: FINAL MIX\n
  In the original and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts, the command menu had
  four commands: Attack, Magic, Items, and a fourth context-sensitive slot that
  varied depending on what the player had targeted, where they were, etc. The
  command menu has been updated to include "Attack", "Magic", "Items", and
  "Summons" in the fourth slot, which was originally located as a sub-category
  beneath the "Magic" menu. The original fourth command has been replaced by the
  introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by
  pressing the Triangle Button. The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom
  Hearts II, utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the
  player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora, as opposed to the
  original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the
  camera. Overall, the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it
  would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re:Chain of Memories, to
  create a more consistent play style throughout the series.
  .
  KINGDOM HEARTS: RE:CHAIN OF MEMORIES\n
  This version of Chain of Memories was released in Europe and Australia for the
  first time as part of the collection, as it was previously released in North
  America in December 2008.

description:
  Mass Effect is set in the year 2183 AD. Thirty-five years prior, humankind
  discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically
  advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this
  technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has
  established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species
  within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the
  various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of
  the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one
  of many independent bodies that make up the collective of "Citadel space". The
  Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war
  they have participated in was the "First Contact War" in 2157. A human
  exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice
  considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and
  proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to
  starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the
  human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human
  Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In
  response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that
  humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in.
  The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as
  a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up
  of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of
  mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the
  short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in
  the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the
  aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the
  environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to
  exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game
  takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and
  the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the
  Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization.
  Throughout the game, however, the player may navigate the Normandy to various
  planets, moons and other destinations.

  Controlling a mysterious figure who has inherited the legacy of the evil,
  long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old
  Overlord's Dark Tower. Only your actions determine if you will rise to become
  the new all-powerful Overlord; it's all down to how much of a fiend you want to
  be in order to succeed...evil or really evil! With plenty of black humor and
  dark irony, the game immerses players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy
  scenarios and characters. Overlord's key innovation is the introduction of an
  array of impish creatures: the minions. They believe you are the old Overlord
  reborn and will use their unique skills to fetch, fight, and die for you.
  Throughout the game, players actively control a horde of these gremlin-like
  critters, and they follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for
  the minions, life-threatening it is.

  A game about the internal and external conflicts of a group of troubled high

  typically ordinary day-to-day of a Tokyo high schooler: attending class,
  after-school activities, and part-time jobs. But they also undertake fantastical
  adventures by using otherworldly powers to enter the hearts of people. Their
  power comes from the Persona, the Jungian concept of the "self"; the game's
  heroes realize that society forces people to wear masks to protect their inner
  vulnerabilities, and by literally ripping off their protective mask and
  confronting their inner selves do the heroes awaken their inner power, and using
  it to help those in need. Ultimately, the group of Phantom Thieves seeks to
  change their day-to-day world to match their perception and see through the
  masks modern society wears.

  Portal 2 is a 2011 first-person puzzle-platform video game developed and
  published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was
  released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3,
  and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts
  while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by
  Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010,
  following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the
  original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the
  Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13
  independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof
  to release Portal 2 several hours early.
  .
  The game retains Portal‍ '​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including
  tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels'
  accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or
  place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the
  Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of
  Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell,
  awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the
  now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by
  the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new
  characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K.
  Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The
  National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player
  cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are
  each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles.
  Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional
  downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and
  share test chambers with others.
  .
  Although some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of
  expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim,
  particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain,
  Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the
  challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative
  mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several
  named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the
  greatest video games of all time.

  person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated
  Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With
  a cover-up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy
  all evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the
  city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of
  the mysterious outbreak. Caught up in the action are rookie police officer Leon
  S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security
  Service (U.S.S) Soldier and battle against all the competing forces at play in
  Raccoon City. Choose from six characters, each one equipped with a unique skill
  set, including the female field scientist Four-Eyes who can manipulate the
  T-virus and take control of the B.O.W's raiding the streets of Raccoon City or
  the weapons expert and U.S.S team captain Lupo.

description:
  In the beginning, a Nazi naval officer and a group of German sailors on board
  the battleship Tirpitz have been tricked into thinking B.J. Blazkowitz is the
  general after donning the general's hat, boots, and jacket. After seeing blood
  dripping from the edge of the jacket, the sailors realize that there's a spy on
  board who has killed the actual general. As Blazkowitz fights the men on board
  he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing
  object hidden in the jacket.
  .
  He finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders
  the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a
  shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic
  energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German
  airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA
  headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion
  needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its
  full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general
  named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by
  an unknown informant. He then meets up with agents from the Kreisau Circle, and
  with them, makes it to Isenstadt.
