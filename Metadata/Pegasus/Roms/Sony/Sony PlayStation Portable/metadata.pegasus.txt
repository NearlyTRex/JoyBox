description:
  The 3rd Birthday is a third-person role-playing shooter co-developed by Square
  Enix's "1st Production Department" and HexaDrive, and published by Square Enix
  for the PlayStation Portable. It was released in Japan in 2010 and in North
  America and Europe in 2011. The game is both the third entry in the Parasite Eve
  video game series, based on the titular Japanese novel, and a spin-off, having
  only a loose connection to events from past games. The game features a
  third-person shooter-based combat system with role-playing mechanics. A key
  mechanic is the Overdive ability, which allows the player to possess
  pre-positioned human allies and inflict damage upon enemies.
  .
  The game takes place in 2013, a year after creatures known as the Twisted have
  appeared from beneath Manhattan and decimated the city. To fight back against
  the Twisted, an investigatory team called the Counter Twisted Investigation
  (CTI) is formed. Among their number is series protagonist Aya Brea, who was
  found unconscious and suffering amnesia two years before the game's events.
  Using her Overdive ability, Aya travels into the past to alter the outcome of
  battles against the Twisted. At the same time, Aya attempts to find out the
  origin of the Twisted and regain her memories.

  towns and villages, mountains, lakes, and deserts.

  Many adventurers delved into these labyrinths dreaming of riches, and those

  natural that the children of our world began to look upon these heroes with

  Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars is a 2007 racing video game developed by Sniper Studios
  and Black Hole Entertainment, and part of the Crazy Taxi series. A compilation
  of Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2, Black Hole Entertainment ported the original
  games from the Dreamcast to the PlayStation Portable, while Sniper Studios added
  a new multiplayer mode. A new single-player campaign was foregone due to budget
  and time constraints. In the multiplayer, players compete against one another
  for customers and fare money. While Crazy Taxi received numerous ports, Fare
  Wars gained notoriety as the sole port of Crazy Taxi 2 outside of the Dreamcast
  version. It was released in North America, Australia, and Europe in August and
  September 2007, followed by a Japanese release in August 2008.
  .
  The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the gameplay of the
  original games, albeit calling it dated, as well as the new multiplayer mode.
  However, they criticized compromises made to bring the two Dreamcast games to
  the system of the less powerful PlayStation Portable, such as lower frame rate
  and higher loading times, the removal of the original games' licensed
  soundtracks, and control issues. The game's developers noted difficulty in
  porting the games to such limiting hardware.

  Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars combines the games Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2, leaving
  their respective original gameplay intact. In the single-player mode, the
  player, controlling one of several yellow cab drivers, each with their own
  unique cab, must drive around the city, picking up passengers and racing
  recklessly to get them to where they need to go in the fastest time. When each
  passenger is dropped off, the player earns a fare and extra time on the limited
  countdown clock, while extra money can be earned by performing stunts.
  .
  The ports also carry over the games' minigame modes, Crazy Box and Crazy
  Pyramid. In the former, players can access nine minigames, including bowling and
  bursting balloons with their taxi. The latter, while similar, includes minigames
  that utilize the "Crazy Hop" feature included in the sequel, which allows the
  taxi to leap through the use of hydraulics.
  .
  Fare Wars adds three new multiplayer modes. In Time Trials mode, players can use
  ad-hoc multiplayer to compete to see who earns the most money within a certain
  time limit. In C-R-A-Z-Y mode, one player attempts to beat the other player's
  score for an individual fare, while in the final mode, Head to Head, two players
  compete to win on the same map. If one player hits the opponent's car, they can
  steal the passenger from their opponent.

  Killian von Rohcoff's life has started out bad, and is about to get worse. He
  shakes off a hangover to get to his graduation only to find out he's finished
  second to his hated rival. Then when he finally gets a lead on a job, it ends up
  getting him robbed and nearly killed...and that's just the beginning. Soon
  Killian and his new "acquaintances" will end up getting caught up in much larger
  events that revolve around an ancient artifact called the Wicked Stone.

  Crimson Gem Saga is a turn-based RPG and a follow-up to Astonishia Story, with
  overworld travel being done on an isometric plane. The game has some minor
  action elements sprinkled into the turn-based gameplay, like critical combo
  chains and an ambush system. Characters level up individually, but all draw from
  a group pool of skill points in order to unlock and gain new skill abilities,
  some of which are combination attacks. In essence, the core gameplay is very
  similar to a Japanese RPGs, despite the fact that the game was developed by a
  Korean company.

  through which you can call another character to execute attacks on your
  opponent, or take a hit for you. The story mode also has the addition of a
  free-roam game world, retaining the tile-based system of its predecessor only
  for dungeons entered from the gameworld via "gateways". As before, it retains
  the character level-up and equipment/skill customisation elements.

  Dungeons & Dragons Tactics is a fantasy role-playing game, utilizing the 3.5
  Edition core rule set, which takes place in the eastern border reaches of the
  Lindesi, a group of kingdoms governed by a human High-King far to the West,
  .
  Players begin a campaign by selecting or creating a character to be the hero,
  then selecting, or creating a group of companions to form the party. At the
  start, you may only have five companions in your party, but as the campaign
  continues, you may recruit up to eleven companions. You may select pre-generated
  characters, create your own group of characters for the party, or even use the
  quick-start option which will automatically provide you with a set of
  pre-generated characters. If the main hero you create or select for the campaign
  dies, the campaign will end. You may select from all eleven core character
  classes: barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue,
  sorcerer, and wizard, plus the psionic warrior and psion. Additional party
  members you may recruit during the adventure are found in the marketplace, for
  example, you may recruit clerics and paladins at the Temple, and fighters,
  barbarians and psychic warriors may be recruited at the Mercenary Hall.
  .
  The adventure is played by moving the party icon along the map, where you make
  choices on which locations to enter, and with whom you may interact, but combat
  is handled in turn-based tactics fashion, on a grid with five-foot squares,
  where initiative determines the order when each character moves, and each
  character during their turn may perform actions according to the 3.5 Edition
  combat rules. Each character, however, has several options during their turn
  from the Action menu. Spells and psionics are also available for the appropriate
  characters. For those unfamiliar with the 3.5 Edition rule set, the manual has a
  glossary of D&D rules terms and there is a glossary available from the main menu
  in the game.
  .
  Wireless multiplayer mode allows you to host or join a game with up to four
  players, featuring game modes such as Dungeon Bash, or Deathmatch Battle, but
  you are only permitted to use pre-generated characters.

  across the battlefield. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess:
  Fistful of Cake because players can switch between five different character
  classes, literally, at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation,
  whether it is flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard,
  healing him while he charges into battle, or adding muscle to carry the hearty
  princess to safety. The comical, quirky, and loveable cast of characters in Fat
  Princess: Fistful of Cake has been developed specifically for optimization on

  Final Fantasy: Type-0 is an RPG in the Final Fantasy series. It is part of the
  Fabula Nova Crystallis project and, although not having much to do with Final
  Fantasy XIII, shares its mythology.
  .
  The game is a RPG in which the characters travel to get missions and attack
  enemy strongholds to complete them. In each mission, three characters out of 14
  are selected, each having their own style, weapons and abilities. The battle
  system is an Active System Battle (ATB) that allows the control of many
  characters, Characters who were KO'd in battle must be revived in town before
  being used again. Each character have a unique summon that can be used for 5
  minutes in battle and can be levelled-up. The ATB kai, as it is called, allows
  for up to three players to connect via ad-hoc and send each other emergency
  back-up.
  .
  Final Fantasy: Type-0 is set in the world of Orience, divided in four kingdoms:
  the Suzaku Fiefdom of Rubrum, the Milites Empire, the Lorican Alliance, and the
  Kingdom of Concordia, each having its own emblem based on four Japanese
  mythological beasts: the phoenix Suzaku, the Turtle Genbu, the tiger Byakko and
  the dragon Seiryuu. Every kingdom is in possession of a crystal that an mark
  humans as their servants, called l'Cie. Character growth is based on the Alto
  Crystarium system, using energy called phantoma to increase the character's
  abilities.
  .
  The later released PC, PS4 and Xbox One versions are called Final Fantasy:
  Type-0 HD. They are available worldwide instead of the Japan-only PSP version.
  The content is almost completely identical, with a focus on localization and
  improvised visuals. It does not have the multiplayer functionality of the PSP
  version, but adds additional difficulty levels.

developer: Square Enix
publisher: Square Enix
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  Final Fantasy Tactics was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into
  different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy
  series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the
  1st game during the Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable
  playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.
  .
  In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet
  during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies
  waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job)
  system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist.
  Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more
  advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain
  monsters and computer controlled "guests" with their own jobs and special
  abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which
  leads to nearly endless combinations.
  .
  The PSP version of the game mostly reiterates the original for the PSOne. Visual
  presentation is almost a 1:1 copy, looking like the old version with a zoomed-in
  camera to make it fit the PSP screen. Port developer Tose added cel-shaded
  introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter
  ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event
  scenes.
  .
  Also the PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final
  Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes have
  been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was
  available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless
  multiplayer options available once you've reached the world map (just go into a
  bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is
  Cooperative Challenge (team mission).

publisher: Atlus
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  In a land ravaged by disparity where the impoverished must battle for survival,
  the fate of all is thrust into uncertainty when rebels happen upon custody of a
  young female noble and a magical spear of immeasurable power falls from the
  heavens. Now, hunted by incumbent powers desperate to reclaim the girl and armed
  with a weapon capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage war to
  deliver themselves from the tyranny of their oppressors.\n
  As original as its narrative, Gungnir's strategy RPG mechanics offer a number of
  fresh twists on an expertly honed formula. Building upon the traditional action
  queue of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have a numerical wait
  interval associated with them. Faster actions bear smaller numbers, allowing
  them to precede slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they may
  sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to
  accelerate actions. This classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting
  titles, enriches the Gungnir's deep strategic battles and gives the player far
  more critical decisions to weigh.

  The would-be hero, the narcissistic evil lord, the crossbow-wielding

  one last part to play. The civilized world continues to be laid siege to by
  relentless evil adversaries and all that remains are the ruins of castles and

developer: Sting
publisher: Atlus
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  One side of Berge was bathed in constant light, and is known as Lustrous Berge.
  The other half is cloaked in constant darkness, and is known as Dark Berge. A
  miasma-filled chasm called the Black Precipice divides the two halves and has
  been in place for so long that most residents of the world don’t even know that
  the other half exists... And now, events loom that threaten both halves of the
  world. Fate has chosen a champion from each half, and now, the player must
  choose which champion to play as. The stage has been set. Will it be the best of
  times, or the worst of times?
  .
  In Hexyz Force, players choose one of the two main characters, either young
  priestess Cecilia "Ceci" Armaclite or veteran knight Levant von Schweitzer. Both
  paths tell different parts of the story, so the game is effectively two RPGs in
  one. Combat is initiated on the field map, but much like another Atlus PSP
  title, battles can be avoided by dodging the enemies on the field.
  .
  If combat is entered, the game turns into a standard turn-based RPG, but with a
  rock-paper-scissors elemental system called the Divine Aspects. Each weapon is
  linked to an element, and if the attacks follow the proper pattern, a damage
  gauge will build that will multiply the damage once the chain breaks. Both the
  enemy and the player have access to the gauge, so the enemy can use it to unload
  huge damage onto the player.
  .
  As is the case with most Sting RPGs, weapons are destructible items. The game
  also has a weapon crafting and fusion system that replaces shops. Players get
  components to create items from battle or by collecting them from Harvest Points
  that are spread around the world.

  Infected is a fast-paced third person comedy zombie shooter. The focus is on a

  As New York Cop Agent Stevens, you find out that not only are you immune to the

  The main focus of the gameplay is shooting holes in the zombies until they are

  explosion. Weaken enough zombies, fire a blood vial into one, and watch the
  chain reaction as exploding zombies send your anti-zombie blood onto other
  zombies.

  The game was one of the first online PSP games, and featured a mode where
  defeating an opponent would give them your virus, and force their avatar online
  to look like your avatar. If they in turn defeated someone, your virus would be
  passed onto them as well. At any time you could look at a world map to see where

developer: Traveller's Tales
publisher: Warner Bros
genre: Platform
description:
  Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and
  Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman
  universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up
  using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular
  fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera
  perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth.
  .
  It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole
  with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share
  nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of
  villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City
  wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his
  sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies
  will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The
  environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and
  the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any
  time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the
  computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing
  their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin
  has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in
  any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.
  .
  Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store
  trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements
  with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode
  into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build
  structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the
  story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.
  .
  In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains
  such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush,
  Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of
  the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This
  way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first
  part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though
  they can die, they immediately respawn.
  .
  Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions
  allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not
  contain any kind of multiplayer option.

description:
  LEGO Indiana Jones 2 for handheld platforms is similar in gameplay to the game
  on consoles, but has simpler graphics and completely different levels. Unlike
  the console game, the handheld version focuses on the fourth Indiana Jones
  movie, with elements from the earlier films only appearing in mini-game format
  and some unlockable bonuses.
  .
  The story of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is retold in three acts of four
  chapters each, with comic-book-style cutscenes between levels. The levels
  themselves follow the usual LEGO game format: players control several characters
  and can switch between them at will. Different characters have different
  abilities which must be used in combination to overcome challenges and solve
  puzzles. For instance, Indy can use his whip, Marion and other female characters
  can cross special ledges and Indy's son Mutt can use his knife to cut ropes and
  can also climb walls. A major part of the game is the collecting of LEGO studs,
  red and gold bricks and other hidden items, which unlock various bonuses like
  additional characters. Finding pages of Indy's journal unlocks one of 16
  mini-games.
  .
  The mini-games are inspired by certain scenes from all four movies, including
  the rolling boulder run from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the mine cart chase from
  Temple of Doom and the three trials from Last Crusade. The games usually task
  the player to survive for a certain time or to collect a certain number of studs
  before dying or reaching the end of the level.

description:
  Song of the Ocean is the third installment in Nihon Falcom's RPG PSP trilogy, a
  third remake based on the games in the early nineties. Despite the number 3 (as
  the third part of the Gagharv Trilogy), it is in fact a remake of the fifth
  title in the series, Umi no Oriuta. This part is a standalone story that takes
  place in the realm of Weltluna, which was once the center of an ancient
  civilization known as the Water Tribe, and the game closes the Gagharv trilogy.
  It draws upon a number of the conventions from the previous titles and provides
  30-50 hours of gameplay.
  .
  You control Forto, who sets off on an adventure to locate a song left behind by
  a legendary composer. The game features an improved battle system, which allows
  you to change party members during battle. While you travel you will meet a
  variety of characters, of whom six will be able to join your party. The game
  also features an extra bonus if you have save data from either of the first two
  Legend of Heroes games on your memory card.
  .
  From time to time, you will come across areas where you can teleport to a
  special section. There, you can team up with characters from the previous games
  and go on optional adventures for experience, money, and items - an addition
  that rewards players who have been following the series from the beginning.

  The Legend of Heroes is old-school JRPG with new-school sensibilities and
  graphics. The old-school elements of the game are its turn-based combat,
  linearity, long dialogue scenes, a digital pet system and lots of similar things

  encounters however. In this game you control Avin in his search for his younger
  sister Eimelle. They were separated when their cathedral was raided by religious
  zealots.

  A Tear of Vermillion is a remake of the Japanese PC game Legend of heroes IV:
  Akai Shizuku. The word Gagharv (in the Japanese title of the remake) refers to
  the chasm that separates the continent Tirasweel, where the games takes place,
  from the rest of the world. Improvements Bandai made for this remake are
  completely re-done 3D graphics, new battle interface, and quicker load times.

  Lemmings team to overcome the hazards ahead: The 'Bomber' explodes at will, the
  'Floater' can survive high falls and the 'Basher' digs horizontally just when
  you need it. The 'Climber' is at hand for those tricky mountain ranges, the
  'Blocker' creates an obstacle in the path ahead and the 'Builder' is there to
  construct walkways for his friends. Stretch your strategies across 100 plus
  levels as you lead your lemmings across an immense variety of challenging
  backdrops. The levels are arranged into five striking themes, each with its own
  unique visual flavour. So, whether it's going underground into the sewers or

  Become a Sackperson, and dress them up as you wish with all sorts of gear that

  Curators, or create your own and send them to the world!
  .
  LittleBigPlanet is a platform game based on the PlayStation 3 game of the same
  name. In it, you control a Sackperson, with the base goal of reaching the level
  exit. However, many physics-based objects and puzzles are encountered along the
  way. There are also many tricks, traps and enemies. Aside from being able to
  jump, your Sackperson can also hop between the two levels of depth (unlike the
  PlayStation 3 version, which features three levels) in the level to walk in
  front or behind objects, grab objects to push or pull them, or even hitch a ride
  on a tethered jetpack and fly about the area.
  .
  A huge feature of LittleBigPlanet is the ability to create and share levels with
  millions of other players around the world. You can make your own levels with
  objects you've collected in the single player mode, and then use those objects
  to make anything you like - whether it be a platform level, action game, music
  box - anything! The level creator allows for a lot of freedom and also offers
  detailed tutorials on how to use and place objects, as well as tweak their
  variables. The PSP version of LittleBigPlanet is not able to play four player
  simultaneous multiplayer like the PS3 version - instead it is a single player
  only game.

description:
  Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time
  ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America,
  Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom.
  Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel
  across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The
  Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.
  .
  Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as
  leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade
  their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for
  your hero team.
  .
  You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's
  Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super
  powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by
  combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen
  foes.
  .
  Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only
  test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the
  cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.
  .
  The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general,
  Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of
  2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP
  release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional
  levels.

  PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ
  game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls
  a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels,
  lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and
  lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit
  point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level.
  .
  The main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is
  given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is
  only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save
  and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on
  the number of "moves" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took
  to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a
  stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also
  penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score
  to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results.

  drive your fast car on the streets while being perfectly able to switch the
  vehicles on the run. Yes, on the run, you can jump from car to car during high
  speed, usually jumping on the different cars from the criminals and taking them
  out one by one. But there's more to that than just driving different cars, you
  can drive motorcycles, trucks, boats, even commandeer a helicopter, though there
  are occasions you'll have to deal with the criminals on foot.
  .
  You can select Time Trial, Race, or Career mode. The latter one plays story-wise
  which gives you certain variety of cases to choose from. As you get promoted
  while successfully solving the cases, new cases will become available depending
  upon your rank, from mere Officer to police Commander. This is a highly
  fast-paced game with non-stop action, as most missions leave very little room

  Many centuries after the legendary Holy War that forced humanity to erect a

  Branshaldo Empire and the Aura Republic engaged in an extended war for control
  of the Grantria Peninsula. The conflict eventually ground to a halt and an
  uneasy truce was reached, as neither nation had the resources to continue
  fighting. Even so, the animosity between the two parties never faded, but
  smoldered beneath the surface, always threatening to explode into flames. In the
  resulting tenuous peace, the people of the peninsula began to resume their
  normal lives, always aware that the war could resume at any time.\n
  It was against this backdrop that the protagonist begins their fight against
  rival factions, hordes of ravening monsters controlled by enigmatic puppet

description:
  Resistance: Retribution takes place weeks after the events of the PS3 title
  Resistance: Fall of Man. The player is James Grayson, a former British Marine.
  Grayson finds his brother infected by the Chimera virus and goes on to destroy
  every conversion centre he can find. The Maquis enlist Grayson, and it's his job
  to retake Europe from the Chimera. The game is presented as a third-person
  shooter and makes use of a cover system that allows the player to hide behind
  objects. While hiding from Chimera, Grayson is able to pop out quickly and
  attack the enemy. Covers are locked automatically when Grayson goes near them
  and aiming assistance is also provided.
  .
  Players who own a copy of Resistance 2 and play Resistance: Retribution on a PSP

  LaSalle (from Resistance 2) and is infected with a mutated version of the
  Chimeran virus. In this game mode, Grayson wears a Specter uniform and has
  glowing Chimeran eyes. He can regenerate health, gets access to new weapons and
  breathes underwater. He is also able to reach hidden passages and pick up intel,
  unlocking plasma grenades and even a further expanded story. This game mode ends
  when the game is quit and progress cannot be saved.

developer: Sting
publisher: Atlus
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  During the great Ragnarok war, the gods of Asgard were overrun by demons from
  Utgard. In order to save the rest of the world from demons, the gods sacrificed
  their lives to create Grim Angels, black-winged warriors armed with sacred
  weapons known as "Diviners". The Grim Angels defeated the demons, and turned
  Utgard into a beautiful land, Riviera.
  .
  Thousand years later, a rumor concerning the demons' return begins to spread.
  Hector, one of the seven Magi entrusted by the gods to watch over Riviera, sends
  the Grim Angels Ein and Ledah there, ordering them to activate the
  "Retribution", a power that would eliminate the demons but also destroy Riviera.
  Ein is defeated by Ursula, Riviera's guardian, and wakes up with amnesia,
  unaware of his past and the role he will have to play in the future of the land.
  .
  Riviera: The Promised Land is a Japanese-style role-playing game. Unlike most
  RPGs, it does not allow the player to physically navigate a character to explore
  the game world. Instead, the player activates "triggers", i.e. events that lead
  to cutscenes, combat, items, etc., by spending special trigger points earned
  during battles. This is done by investigating areas, moving from screen to
  screen.
  .
  Once a turn-based battle is triggered, the player selects three active
  combatants out of the available five, selects a formation for the party (attack-
  or magic-oriented), and chooses which four items to bring into the battle. The
  items activate skills for various characters; if a character has been trained
  with that item, he or she can use powerful "OverSkills" by gradually filling the
  OverDrive gauge. Items can be used a limited amount of times before they break.
  .
  The game also contains dating gameplay elements. The player can make decisions
  for Ein concerning his female companions, raising or lowering their trust level
  and eventually reaching one of the multiple endings determined by the
  relationships between Ein and the young women in his party.

description:
  Set in a fictional German town named Lebensbaum (Life's Tree), Shadow of
  Memories revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the
  beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However,
  he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn
  or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him
  the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras—2001, 1980, 1902 and 1580—as
  he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder
  at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several
  characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the
  year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of
  his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife
  and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in
  1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarette; and
  Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.
  .
  Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the
  stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result
  of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his
  mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track
  Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions,
  Hugo holds either Margarette or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the
  red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher's stone, to resurrect his mother.

game: Tales of Destiny 2 (Japan)

developer: Wolf Team
publisher: Namco
genre: Role-Playing
description:
  Not to be confused with Tales of Destiny II (original name Tales of Eternia),
  this installment in the Tales Of... series, unreleased in the West, is one of
  the few "true" sequels within the franchise, directly connected in its setting
  and plot to Tales of Destiny.
  .
  The story takes place eighteen years after the events depicted in Tales of
  Destiny. Kyle, the son of the previous game's hero, is trying to find support
  for an orphanage operated by his parents. On his journey, he comes into contact
  with a powerful energy source known as Lens. A girl steps out of it, telling
  Kyle that she is on a quest to find a true hero. Naturally, Kyle is that hero;
  and very soon, he will have to prove it, when a mysterious woman uses the power
  of the Lens to revert history, sending Kyle into an alternate universe, in which
  the ancient Aeth'er Wars were won by a different side...
  .
  Gameplay-wise, Tales of Destiny 2 is very similar to its predecessors in the
  series. As before, most of the game is played in a Japanese RPG fashion, with
  town and dungeon exploration, and random combat. The trademark side-scrolling
  action-based battles of the series remain intact in this installment; for the
  first time, a zoom feature allows a more detailed view of combat.
  .
  Player-controlled characters learn skills of different tiers, which can be
  chained into combos. Performing combos increases the damage inflicted on the
  enemy, and provides bonus experience. Powerful special techniques cost TP
  (technical points) as well as SP (spirit points) to execute.

  through side-scrolling stages, defeating enemies and using your best platforming
  skills. The game lets you build up your skills as you progress. You start off
  with just a basic jump, but eventually gain a double jump and even the ability
  to fly. You'll also earn lots of magic spells along the way. The game promises a
  greater number of spells and weapons than ever before. New for Goku Makaimura is
  non-linear gameplay. You're no longer on a fixed path from start to end. The
  levels include branching points and even warp points. By using a warp point, you
  can warp back to previous levels and collecting items that you might have

  Badman from taking over the world!
  .
  Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog
  game, Dungeon Keeper. Players use their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to
  protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create monsters by
  digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients
  inside the block, the more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of
  powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power', which indicates how
  powerful Badman's entire army is.
  .
  Players only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs
  out, they cannot dig through the earth any more, and must rely on the monsters
  to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each level by not
  using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end
  of the level.

developer: Media Vision
publisher: Sony
genre: Role-Playing;Strategy
description:
  Wild Arms XF is a 2D turn-based tactical role-playing game, creating a gameplay
  experience somewhere between Dungeons & Dragons and chess. Players are given
  control of a small squad of characters (six or less) and placed on a grid-based
  map resembling a geographical location (a swamp, a town, a river), upon which
  they fight battles to progress through the game. As with most T/RPGs, positional
  advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver
  their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and
  maneuvering by the inclusion of "Formation Arts," which increase attack damage
  when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a
  circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T/RPGs whose
  battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. "Combination
  Arts" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an
  enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the
  next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an
  uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will
  increase significantly. On the other hand, the enemy gets the same advantage.
