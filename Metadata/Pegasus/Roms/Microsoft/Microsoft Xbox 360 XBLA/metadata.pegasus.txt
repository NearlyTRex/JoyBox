developer: ACE Team
publisher: Atlus
genre: Action;Adventure
description:
  From indie Chilean developer ACE Team comes an Art Nouveau-styled,
  side-scrolling action adventure game featuring a complex fighting engine in
  procedurally generated levels that destine its three warriors to battle for an
  eternity. Enter the bold Katrien, the tortured specter Ghost Monk, and the
  ethereal Pincoya. Perform combos and chain attacks, and release a flurry of
  blows in order to survive what lies beneath. Your path into the unknown may
  start out with three fierce warriors, but when you learn to possess your
  enemies, you can challenge the abyss with their skills and combat abilities. Use
  these abilities available to you and attempt to figure out the infinite abyss.
  But the difficulties in accomplishing this great task don't end there! The
  side-scrolling levels never play out the same way twice, from the monsters they
  are filled with, to the locations of life-saving merchants, or the unique
  encounters and treasures to be found.

  to grapple to and swing from objects. New bionic enhancements include abilities
  such as hacking data terminals, a powerful uppercut, and firing grenades.

  The game's plot revolves around a dictator named General Sabio and a missing
  commander from Spencer's organization, Colonel Brubaker. Spencer and a team of
  four other bionics are sent to locate Brubaker and his platoon and help them
  complete their mission of disarming Sabio's missiles. The team's original

genre: Platform;Puzzle
description:
  Braid is a puzzle-platformer, drawn in a painterly style, where you can
  manipulate the flow of time in strange and unusual ways. From a house in the
  city, journey to a series of worlds and solve puzzles to rescue an abducted
  princess. In each world, you have a different power to affect the way time
  behaves, and it is time's strangeness that creates the puzzles. The time
  behaviors include: the ability to rewind, objects that are immune to being
  rewound, time that is tied to space, parallel realities, time dilation, and
  perhaps more.
  .
  Braid treats your time and attention as precious; there is no filler in this
  game. Every puzzle shows you something new and interesting about the game world.

  Master strategy in the medieval world! In the classic board game Carcassonne,
  the medieval countryside thrives as you and your opponents place tiles and

  the largest towns, longest roads, and biggest farms.
  .
  Carcassonne is a turn-based strategy game for 2 to 5 players based on the German
  board game of the same name. By playing land tiles one by one, players build up
  a landscape of cities, roads, farms, and monasteries. Players compete to claim
  control of the features they build with a limited supply of follower pieces.
  Judging where to play the tiles and when to use a follower or not is a
  deceptively simple process - yet the depth of the game stems from judging when
  and where to use the followers to gain the most points.

  The Cave's story is based on a magical talking cave with a labyrinthine set of
  tunnels within it. Seven characters, drawn from across time and space, have come
  to the Cave, believing they can "learn something about themselves and who they
  might become", as stated by Gilbert, while harboring a dark secret.[5] In one
  example, a knight character, seeking a treasured amulet, encounters a princess
  who possesses the amulet in distress from a dragon; instead of coming to the
  princess' rescue, he lures the dragon into eating her and recovering the amulet
  for himself when the dragon coughs it up.[6]\n
  At the start of the game, the player selects three of the seven characters,
  which they are then locked to for the remainder of the game; players can restart
  a new game to select a different trio of characters. The characters are based on
  stereotypical figures, such as a hillbilly, a pair of orphans (acting as one
  character), and a scientist.

description:
  Frogger 2 is a top-down platform game largely based around the gameplay of the
  original Frogger. The introduction story tells how the alien Pico is forced to
  land in Firefly Swamp where Frogger resides. His space ship broke down in
  different pieces and Frogger promises to collect them all. He progresses through
  different stages where he needs to hop over water, lava, and through a factory.
  .
  Using the analog stick or the D-pad it is possible to hop in four directions, as
  if the level is divided into tiles, and often Frogger has to pass over moving
  objects quickly, just like the logs in the original game. He can stretch his
  tongue to collect coins and musical notes. When four of the latter have been
  collected, he is warped to a bonus level. Levels are split up into different
  sections with checkpoints and are rendered in a 4:3 ratio with a pattern filling
  the rest of the background.
  .
  Singleplayer is available as a Story mode and Time Trials. Multiplayer is
  supported online with four different modes, for instance racing to a finish line
  while hindering each other with the tongue, or guarding a jewel as long as
  possible.

description:
  Ghostbusters: Sanctum of Slime is an action video game developed by Behaviour
  Santiago, and published by Atari.
  .
  The gameplay is a four player co-op twinstick shooter. Players must defeat
  hordes of ghosts in each room before eventually reaching the boss of each level.
  Each Ghostbuster is equipped with three proton streams, red, yellow, and blue,
  and the correct color must be switched to to defeat ghosts of a similar color.
  In addition each stream can produce effects on some enemies even if they are a
  different color: red slows enemies, yellow causes them to pause, and blue
  bounces off of obstacles. Stronger ghosts can sometimes leave behind powerups
  like double damage or bonus points. Points are awarded for chaining together
  defeats of ghosts, destroying property, or reviving teammates. In addition to
  the normal walking levels there are two levels where the Ghostbusters ride in
  the back of the Ecto-4WD, and must defend the vehicle from attacking ghosts. If
  less than four players are present AI will fill in for the missing slots.

  agreement. In January 2021, a full playthrough was streamed to YouTube,
  showcasing improved graphics and 60 frame-per-second gameplay. A week later, a
  near-final playable ROM image of the XBLA title was leaked online from an

  As a spin-off of the Bubble Bobble series, the game features slightly similar

  their way to the top of several long, vertical stages with the aid of rainbows,
  which they can create.
  .
  Instead of health or a set number of lives, the game uses a time limit, which
  ends the game if it reaches zero. Getting hit by enemies will lose valuable
  seconds, but defeating enemies with rainbows will sprout forth gems that can
  replenish time. By defeating multiple enemies in a row, more valuable gems with
  bigger time bonuses are awarded. At certain points in the game, Dr Crescent will
  attack from below in one of his machines. Players can either try to defeat him,
  or evade him until the next checkpoint. By collecting seven colored gems,
  players can use a special attack against these mini-bosses.
  .
  In the Xbox Live Arcade version, players can use their Avatars in the Time
  Attack and Challenge modes.

developer: Konami
publisher: Konami
genre: Action;Platformer;2D
description:
  Rush'N Attack: Ex-Patriot is the sequel to Rush'n Attack and the third main game
  in the series, following the arcade-only game M.I.A.: Missing in Action. As a
  run-and-gun platformer it stays true to the spirit of the original game, but
  with a 2.5D perspective; the game visuals are in 3D but the player is able to
  move only over the horizontal and vertical plane, with occasional close-ups for
  certain kills. The player controls Sid Morrow who secretly infiltrates Russian
  territory fifteen years after the Cold War. His mission is to retrieve Rory
  Gibson, a member of team Harvest who was originally sent in during the war to
  investigate a material called Ulyssium that would be used to power nuclear
  missiles. As the war eventually ended without a confrontation, the team was
  extracted but Gibson was left behind. Not only is Morrow on a rescue mission
  fifteen years later, also needs to verify intelligence that the Russians may
  have reinstated the nuclear program and if that turns out to be true, he needs
  to sabotage it.
  .
  Just like the original game there is a focus on melee combat. Morrow moves at a
  high speed and uses his trusty knife to take out enemies, based on the Russian
  martial arts technique Systema. He can perform a slide attack, use brutal
  finishers, push buttons, climb platforms to attack enemies there, slide down
  ladders, use elevators, and jump. Many enemies can still be taken out with a
  single hit, but the one hit death for the player has been replaced with a health
  bar and health pick-ups. Next to the knife Morrow can also temporarily use
  ranged weapons such as rocket launchers, grenades and rifles. The top right
  corner holds a mini-map where an abstract lay-out of the environment is shown
  with enemies. The story is often furthered through short scenes. Certain parts
  have different level paths and stealth can be applied to sneak past enemies or
  to hide in a dark passage. Certain kills, especially when using stealth, are
  rewarded with more points. Once discovered however, an alarm may be sounded and
  Morrow needs to rush the rest of the level. While progressing different combos
  can be unlocked. The game is saved automatically at certain checkpoints. The
  game takes place in three environments: a prison, a laboratory and a nuclear
  base, and there is always a boss at the end to defeat.

developer: Grasshopper Manufacture
publisher: Microsoft Game Studios
genre: Action;Shooter;Shoot-'Em-Up;Horizontal
description:
  Sine Mora (Latin for "without delay") is a 2.5D horizontally side-scrolling
  shooter. The ship's movement is limited to two axes, but the camera sweeps and
  the different layers show the environment and objects are rendered in 3D. The
  game has a dieselpunk theme with robots and floating machinery. The player
  controls Argus Pytel's ship. He is part of a team of partisan pilots who
  determine to infiltrate Syriad, a floating fortress that guards the planet. They
  are after antagonist Ronotra Koss who has smuggled robots and kidnapped a girl
  of great importance.
  .
  The game is played as a bullet hell shooter where the screen is flooded with
  enemies and bullets. It is however more forgiving as the standard health
  mechanic is replaced by a timer that counts down. Each hit drains the timer
  further, while shooting down opponents extends it. The goal is to reach the end
  of different sections before time is up. The environments do not only include
  air events, but are also set underwater. Typically the end part of a level holds
  a giant boss with strong attacks. The ship has a primary weapon and can collect
  different powerful sub weapons with limited ammo. Shooting with the primary
  weapon builds up a score multiplier while the sub weapon resets it. Defeated
  ships leave behind power-up tokens such as time extension, sub weapon, score
  bonus, and shield. There are also tokens to upgrade the primary weapon's
  firepower in up to 9 steps. These upgrades are permanent, but each time the ship
  is hit a red upgrade token is dropped and it needs to be collected again before
  it disappears. Additionally a time capsule can be activated to temporarily slow
  down time in the environment. The player's ship can still move and shoot at
  regular speed and it becomes easier to navigate through a cloud of bullets.
  .
  The game modes include Story, Arcade, and Score Attack. At the beginning of the
  game there are two difficulty levels, but during gameplay sometimes an easy or a
  more difficult route can be chosen as well.

description:
  The story picks up from the ending of Sonic 3 - Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon,
  the Death Egg, has been badly damaged in the climactic battle between himself
  and Sonic The Hedgehog. As the satellite falls back to the Floating Island,
  landing in a volcanic crater, Sonic jumps off, landing in a mushroom filled
  woodland.\n
  Sonic knows there are many Chaos Emeralds hidden on the island, including the
  powerful Super Emeralds and the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's
  levitation powers. Worried that Robotnik may try to harness this power to fuel a
  repaired Death Egg, he sets off to try and destroy the Death Egg once and for
  all, keeping an eye out for Knuckles the Echidna, still smarting from his Launch
  Base defeat.\n
  At Hidden Palace, Sonic finds Knuckles there waiting for him. They fight and
  Sonic seems to emerge victorious when Knuckles flees from the duel after sensing
  someone is trying to steal the Master Emerald. Knuckles races ahead closely
  followed by Sonic to find Robotnik trying to steal the Master Emerald: It had
  been his plan all along to snatch it while Sonic and Knuckles were too busy
  dealing with each other. Realizing he had been tricked, Knuckles reacts by
  attacking Robotnik, which fails when Robotnik electrocutes Knuckles. Sonic tries
  to intervene but Robotnik stills manages to escape. Knuckles now realizes his
  mistake and that Sonic is in fact on his side. They join forces and teleport to
  Sky Sanctuary.\n
  At Sky Sanctuary, Knuckles and Sonic watch the Death Egg launching in the
  background. Knuckles activates a bridge so Sonic can cross over. Sonic defeats a
  rebuilt Metal Sonic on the way to the Death Egg, and manages to board it before
  it leaves the atmosphere. Onboard the Death Egg, Sonic defeats Robotnik and
  destroys the ship once and for all, only for Robotnik to get away with the
  Master Emerald in one of his giant robots. If Sonic hasn't collected all seven
  Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds, the game ends here, and the ending in
  which the Master Emerald does not return to Angel Island occurs. After the
  credits, the player sees a scene with Robotnik still in possession of the Master
  Emerald.\n
  If all the seven Chaos Emeralds and/or Super Emeralds are collected, Sonic
  transforms into Super Sonic or Hyper Sonic and chases Robotnik into the Doomsday
  Zone. After failing to lose him in an asteroid belt, Robotnik's machine is
  destroyed, Sonic and Tails return the Master Emerald, and the Floating Island
  becomes airborne once again. If the player didn't collect all the Super
  Emeralds, a scene occurs which shows an Egg Robo emerging from a pile of metal.
  If all Emeralds are collected, the player sees the Sonic 3 and Knuckles logo
  featuring Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles.

  Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2006 platform video game developed by Sonic Team and
  published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game allows the player
  to choose from stories centered on Sonic, Shadow and new character Silver the
  Hedgehog. The plot follows Sonic's quest to rescue Princess Elise from Dr.
  Eggman and ultimately the three main characters attempt to prevent the future
  being destroyed by a monster named Iblis after the Flames of Disaster are
  released.
  .
  Sonic's levels are standard for the series, focusing on running and platforming
  though the game introduces new "Mach Speed" stages that force the player to run
  forward and avoid obstacles at high speed. Shadow's levels are very similar to
  Sonic but tend to feature heavy use of vehicles. Silver's levels are very
  different from the other two as they are slower paced and have the player use
  Silver's telekinesis to navigate levels and solve platforming puzzles. The three
  main characters are each accompanied by two side characters such as Tails and
  Knuckles for Sonic.

  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 (Japanese: ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグ2ツー Hepburn: Sonikku za Hejjihoggu
  Tsū?) is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team, with assistance from
  Sega Technical Institute, and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console. It
  was released worldwide in November 1992. The game is the second main entry in
  the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and the first to feature Miles "Tails" Prower, a
  flying two-tailed fox. He and protagonist Sonic the Hedgehog must stop the
  series antagonist Dr. Ivo Robotnik from stealing the Chaos Emeralds in order to
  power his space station, called the Death Egg.
  .
  Development of the game began in November 1991, two months later than originally
  intended, because Sega of America felt that it was too soon for a sequel. Both
  American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development; art director
  Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the game's new 3D special stages, based on
  an earlier tech demo created by Yuji Naka. The staff increased the speed of
  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in comparison to its predecessor. As with the original
  game, the soundtrack was composed by Masato Nakamura.
  .
  Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was a critical and commercial success. It has sold over six
  million copies, making it the second-best-selling Genesis game behind the
  original Sonic the Hedgehog. It has since been released in several compilations
  and downloads for various platforms, which were also generally positively
  received. A remastered version was released on iOS and Android devices in
  December 2013, including new features such as Boss Rush and Time Attack modes,
  and the 'Hidden Palace Zone', which was scrapped from the original 1992 release.
  Two sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, were released in 1994.

publisher: Microsoft Game Studios
genre: Strategy
description:
  South Park is under attack, again, and Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman must
  overcome a series of tower defense challenges to save the town. Players use
  coins dropped by defeated enemies to construct and upgrade new automated
  defenses along a linear path. In typical South Park style, towers include
  homemade fireworks launchers and barbecue grill lasers that bloodily dismember
  enemies such as cows, Ginger kids, hippies, and Mongolians.
  .
  Aside from the towers, each of the four boys can be placed and controlled. They
  can throw snowballs as a source of extra attack power, collect dropped coins
  used to purchase towers and upgrades, and trigger a special power unique to each
  character. These powers range from restoring some of the defended object's
  health, to clearing the screen of enemies with a fire attack. In single-player,
  the player switches between each of the four boys, positioning them or taking
  control as needed. In multiplayer, each player is assigned a character they
  stick with for that level.
  .
  There are 11 levels structured like an episode of the show. Animated stills
  voiced by the show's actors set up each level; explaining the objective to be
  defended, and furthering the boys' search for the mastermind behind the attacks.
  Players can unlock 12 additional playable characters (with unique special
  abilities) through playing, as well as video clips from the show in a
  "scrapbook" viewable from the main menu.

developer: Twisted Pixel Games
publisher: Microsoft Game Studios
genre: Action;Platform
description:
  'Splosion Man is an action platformer in which you take on the role of 'Splosion
  Man in his quest to elude the scientists and robots of The Big Science Company.
  The goal is to clear as many levels as possible, as fast as possible, while
  scoring as many points as possible. With this in mind players spend the majority
  of their time running, jumping, and utilizing 'Splosion Man's signature means of
  locomotion, the "splode", a series of up to three jumps, each punctuated with an
  explosion that takes out enemies in range. This tactic is important not only for
  the hilarious affect it has on scientists - literally turning them into cold
  cuts - and as a means of enacting dramatic platforming moves, but also as a way
  to increase players' scores, which in part is based on the number of enemies
  bested. The power to pull off this ability is not limitless though, and must be
  recharged after used three times in series. Points can also be scored in other
  ways, including finding cakes, which are 'Splosion Man's favorite food, hidden
  throughout the gameplay area. As a natural result of the importance of speed, as
  the game progresses through its 50 levels, action in the game grows more
  challenging. Players having difficulty completing levels can opt instead to
  follow the comical "Way of the Coward", which after a certain amount of deaths
  in a single spot allows the player to skip the current level and proceed to the
  next. The embarrassing trade-off for this free pass is that players start off
  the next level dressed in a tutu, and of course a less than spectacular score.
  Additional features rounding out the gameplay of 'Splosion Man include
  puzzle-solving, 2-4 player coop in both in local play and via Xbox LIVE,
  unlockable bonuses for use throughout Xbox LIVE, custom interactive soundtracks,
  leaderboard support, and voice messaging.

  A new entry in the Vandal Hearts series, Flames of Judgement follows the story
  of young orphan Tobias Martin as he bands together with his schoolmates to help
  defend his homeland against a rival kingdom. The story acts as a prequel to the
  original Vandal Hearts.
  .
  The series' trademark isometric combat returns, now presented in 3-D with 3-D
  character models. Players attempt to position themselves tactically to gain an
  advantage over stronger (or more numerous) foes. Combat takes place in turns,
  with each side moving one character per turn. Each party member can carry two
  weapons and switch between them without using up a "turn," allowing them to
  shift quickly from a sword to a long-range bow, for example. Characters gain
  levels through successful battles, and increase skills with a particular weapon
  or spell by using that weapon or spell in combat.
  .
  Many engagements expand beyond simple combat by introducing some sort of puzzle
  element, ranging from pushing boulders to protecting characters from attackers.
  Missions may also radically update their goals as progress is made. In addition
  to the standard game, there are also multiple endings and multiple "secret maps"
  unlocked across the regular levels.

  Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and
  published by Apogee Software. Originally released on May 5, 1992, for the PC
  operating system DOS, the game was inspired by the 1980s Muse Software video
  games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. A promotional version of
  Wolfenstein 3D was released as shareware, which permitted it to be copied
  widely. The game was later ported to a wide range of computer systems and video
  game consoles.
  .
  The shareware release contains one episode consisting of ten levels. The
  commercial release consists of three episodes, which include the shareware
  episode and two subsequent episodes. Later releases included a three-episode
  mission pack titled The Nocturnal Missions. The player assumes the role of a
  World War II Allied spy William "B.J." Blazkowicz, who is trying to escape from
  Castle Wolfenstein, a Nazi German prison. After the initial escape episode,
  Blazkowicz carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis.
  .
  Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as
  having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic
  run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter game

description:
  Unlike most of the previous 2D Worms games, Worms Ultimate Mayhem features a 3D,
  turn-based artillery strategy that allows player to move freely rather from left
  and right. In the game lobby, players are able to choose from a wide variety of
  different weapons and use them when the game starts. At the start of the game
  each player is able to control four worms, due to the game turned-base nature,
  each player control one worm at a time with a set time limit; when the time
  limit expires or when the worm fires a weapon, the player's turn will end and
  the opponent will start his turn. The objective of the game is to eliminate all
  of the enemy team worms. There are two ways that a worm can be eliminated. The
  simplest way is to deplete the worm of its health, that can be done by choosing
  a weapon, aiming it at the enemy worm, and firing at the opposing team worm. The
  second way is to knock the worm out of the platform; some weapons provide the
  ability to push or knock back the opposing worm. Once a worm is eliminated, it
  cannot be brought back to life and once all four of a player's worms are
  eliminated the game will end. The team with worms left standing is the winner.
