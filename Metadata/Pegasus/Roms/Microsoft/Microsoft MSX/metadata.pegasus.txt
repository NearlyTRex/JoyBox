description:
  Ping Pong recreates the fast-paced sport of table tennis. To win each match you
  must get to 10 points with a 2 point lead - if the scores reach 10-9 the game
  goes on until someone has a 2 point lead or reaches 15, in a similar manner to
  tennis. There are nine skill levels to beat, with increasing abilities as the
  game goes on. The human player has the advantage of serving first, and as the
  serve reverses every five points, you are guaranteed to have more chances to
  serve than your opponent (remember the significance of 10 and 15 in the
  scoring). The points system rewards long rallies and large winning margins, as
  you get points for each hit, for each point won, and for each point of the
  winning margin.

  invaders, escaped Sard, and took control of the space surrounding the planet

  Bacterion army before they conquer the planet.

  acquired, their effects ranging from slowing down enemies to turning the
  Metalion into an invincible drill-like machine for a brief amount of time. Boss
  battles are followed by optional mini-stages, which grant the player new weapons
  if completed successfully.

description:
  TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shooter. The players control cartoon-like
  spacecrafts with anthropomorphic arms, player one being TwinBee and player two
  being WinBee. The spacecrafts can be moved in all 8 directions, with one button
  for regular shooting flying enemies and one button for dropping ground bombs.
  .
  Power-ups in the form of bells can be collected by shooting clouds. The color of
  the bell will change if it is shot by the player, assuming one of the possible
  colors:
  .
  Yellow: grants bonus points;\n
  White: upgrades player's guns to a twin cannon;\n
  Blue: increases player's speed (up to five levels);\n
  Green: creates image copies of the craft for more firepower;\n
  Red: provides a shield to sustain damage.
  .
  The green and red bells cannot be combined. Alternate power ups can be collected
  from the ground, such as an alternate bell which upgrades the craft with a three
  way gun and a star which destroys all enemies on screen.
  .
  One shot in the middle section of the craft will destroy it. Shots which hit one
  of the craft's arms will destroy only the arm. If both arms are lost, the craft
  won't be able to shoot bombs anymore and will have to be repaired by an
  ambulance.
  .
  In the two-player mode, TwinBee (cyan craft) and WinBee (red craft) have the
  same speed and they can join "hand-to-hand" and fire a super blast. Also in two
  player mode, if one craft is hit by the other from behind, it will fire four
  multi-directional shots.
