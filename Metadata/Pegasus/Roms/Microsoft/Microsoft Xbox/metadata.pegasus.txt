genre: Action;Sandbox
description:
  During the last years of his reign, the North Korean president Choi Kim
  attempted a reconciliation with the country's southern neighbor, with the
  ultimate goal of reunification. However, his son, General Choi Song, and the
  military clique under his leadership, strongly disagreed with the old man's
  views. Eventually, Choi Song orchestrated his own father's assassination, took
  control of North Korea, and severed ties with the outside world.
  .
  Eventually, plans of a nuclear reactor construction began to surface. China,
  South Korea, the Allied Nations and even the Russian Mafia sent troops to North
  Korea, competing for power in the troubled region. A bounty of a hundred million
  dollars for General Song was declared. This is where the mercenaries enter the
  playfield.
  .
  Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction is a free-roaming war action and driving
  game with open-ended gameplay in a large world. The player can choose to control
  any of the three mercenary protagonists, each with their own strengths: North
  American Chris Jacobs can sustain higher damage; Jennifer Mui from Hong-Kong is
  proficient in stealth; Mattias Nilsson from Sweden can run faster than the
  others. Each of the mercenary also speaks different languages, which makes him
  or her more or less suitable for work with particular factions.
  .
  Players have free reign of a massive landscape to take bounties on the "Deck of
  52", a list of most wanted criminals in North Korea, as well as a number of
  factions. Four factions have moved in to take advantage of the coup for personal
  gains; each faction will offer the player resources such as vehicles and
  supplies, as well as missions that the player can use to make money off of. If
  the player makes a faction happy, they will offer intel on the locations of
  various bounties from the deck.
  .
  Players have a vast array of resources available to them to get the job done. It
  is possible to commandeer tanks, choppers and and any other military hardware to
  blow up the game's destructible landscape across the North Korean countryside.
  Helping out various factions provides access to numerous vehicle drops, supply
  drops, and air strikes.

  NightCaster is a third-person, single-player, action-adventure game for the
  Xbox, developed by VR1 Entertainment and published by Microsoft. Players take
  the role of Arran, a novice wizard whose magical power grows as he ages
  throughout his quest to collect spells and rid the world of eternal night.
  .
  The start of the story mode introduces the player to Arran, a young boy living
  in a small village. One day, Arran creeps into a forest whilst playing hide and
  seek with his friends, and stumbles upon a glowing floating orb. The orb informs
  him that he must go on a quest to defeat the evil 'Night Caster'. Arran is then
  placed in suspended animation (even though he still ages) by the orb, presumably
  so that he 'will be ready' to fight the Nightcaster.
  .
  Arran wakes up, having aged to around the mid-twenties, to find his world
  devastated by darkness and the legions of monsters under the reign of the
  Nightcaster spreading terror over the populace. Arran's parents are supposedly
  dead when Arran finds his home to be a smoldering wreckage, at which point the
  orb informs him that 'it is the Nightcaster['s doing]'. So he starts his quest
  facing many creatures and as he ages his spells are stronger, more effective and
  more expansive.

  Otogi 2: Immortal Warriors combines fantasy with real life folklore and fast
  paced action. It starts where its predecessor ended and this time Raikoh, the
  hero of the first game, is not alone. Five new warriors join him and combine
  their powers to tackle the task of saving the world from a new demonic threat.
  .
  Gameplay is pretty much your regular hack & slash, and there is lots of it. The
  player advances through levels, destroying huge amounts of mystical enemies with
  different attacks, both physical and magical, while collecting experience which
  lets one improve the skills of the characters. New weapons and accessories can
  be purchased from a store between levels. Challenge levels separate from the
  main game open up as levels are completed, such as ones that task you wish
  surviving against a never ending horde of monsters, or destroying 100 arches in
  a limited time. Almost everything in the game's levels are destroyable, from
  trees to buildings, and the six playable characters are all different so one
  level might be easier to complete with one character than the other.

  set up on each level. This can be used for turbo boosts of course, but it also
  controls the weapons. The weapons are not picked up, but are available whenever

description:
  The story is set in Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, a remote US government
  training facility under the guise of a children's summer camp. The area was hit
  centuries ago by a meteor made of psitanium (a fictional element that can grant
  psychic powers or strengthen existing powers), creating a huge crater. The
  psitanium affected the local wildlife, giving them limited psychic powers, such
  as bears with the ability to attack with telekinetic claws and cougars with
  pyrokinesis. The Native Americans of the area called psitanium "whispering
  rock", which they used to build arrowheads. When settlers began inhabiting the
  region, the psychoactive properties of the meteor slowly drove them insane. An
  asylum was built to house the afflicted, but within fifteen years the asylum had
  more residents than the town did. The government relocated the remaining
  inhabitants and flooded the crater to prevent further settlement, creating what
  is now Lake Oblongata. The asylum still stands but has fallen into disrepair.

  reeling from a recent conflict with the Dark Lords, the ongoing battle between
  the Jedi and the Sith rages on. It's up to guide your customizable and evolving
  characters through ten different worlds, fast-paced minigames, and locations
  including a Sith world, the Wookie homeworld, and the Jedi Academy. Your actions
  determine the outcome of this colossal galactic war--and your destiny as a Jedi.

  The game takes place five years after the events of Knights of the Old Republic,
  in a time when the Jedi have been nearly exterminated by the Sith. The player's
  character, a former Jedi Knight exiled from the Jedi Order, is referred to as
  "The Exile" or "Jedi Exile." Throughout the game, the player's character
  (canonically a female, although the player can choose to play either sex)
  restores their connection to the Force while, with the help of non-player
  character companions, trying to stop the Sith. The player makes choices that
  turn the Exile to either the light side or the dark side of the Force, and
  travels to six planets to either help or hinder the Republic's efforts to bring
  peace and stability to the galaxy.
