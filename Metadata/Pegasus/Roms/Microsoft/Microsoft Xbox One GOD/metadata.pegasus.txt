developer: The Fun Pimps
publisher: The Fun Pimps
genre: Action Adventure;Survival
description:
  It’s an open-world sandbox game to play alone, via splitscreen, or online, that
  gives you an enormous amount of freedom to choose how to survive in a post-
  apocalyptic world. You’re dropped into a harsh environment with almost nothing –
  not even clothes on your back. Through scavenging, crafting, and hunting, you’ll
  eventually put together the basic items you’ll need to live. You’ll have to deal
  with cold, heat, hunger and thirst, and there are wild animals that see you as
  prey. But that’s not the worst, because you’re not alone — the undead wander all
  around you. Slow and relatively easy to avoid by day, at night they become
  merciless, fast-moving killers, hungry for your flesh.
