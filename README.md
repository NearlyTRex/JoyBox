My personal collection of integrated scripts and tools

This is simply a jumble of the various scripts and tools I wrote for my various environments. The goal is to have a consistent environment across my Windows and Linux machines that lets me easily do the things I want to do. This includes my arcade system, along with other random useful things I wrote or found. Making it public in case anyone else wants to utilize this in some way for themselves. But I can't offer any support for others using this.
